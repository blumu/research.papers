\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
    We introduce a method to evaluate untyped lambda terms by combining the theory of traversals, a term-tree traversing technique inspired from Game Semantics~\cite{OngLics2006,BlumPhd}, with judicious use of the eta-conversion rule of the lambda calculus.

    The traversal theory of the simply-typed lambda calculus relies on the eta-long transform to ensure that when traversing an application, there exists a subterm representing every possible operator's argument~\cite{BlumPhd, OngLics2006}. In the untyped setting, we instead exhibit the missing operand via ad-hoc instantiation of the eta-expansion rule, which allows the traversal to proceed as if the operand existed in the original term. This gives rise to a more generic concept of traversals for lambda terms where no preliminary transformation is required: the original unaltered lambda term is traversed.

    %Blindly applying the rules of typed traversals on untyped terms, where eta-long transform is undefined, therefore fails when an operator  node lacks the required operand. To work around this limitation, we create missing operands on-the-fly and proceed as if it existed in the original term. We denote missing operands in the traversals using ``imaginary'' nodes representing nodes that would exist in the term-tree if the application subterm lacking the operand were to be eta-expanded. We call the resulting traversal an ``imaginary traversal''.

    We show that by bounding the non-determinism of the traversal rule for free variables, one can effectively compute a set of traversals characterizing the paths in the tree representation of the beta-normal form, when it exists. This yields an evaluation algorithm for untyped lambda-terms. We prove correctness by showing that traversals implement \emph{leftmost linear reduction}, a generalization of the \emph{head linear reduction} of Danos~\etal \cite{danos-head,danosherbelinregnier1996}.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and related work}

The theory of traversals was originally introduced in the context of higher-order recursion schemes~\cite{OngLics2006} as tree generators, and was
then extended to simply-typed languages with higher-order free variables, such as the simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC)~\cite{BlumPhd}. A traversal consists of a sequence of nodes taken from a tree-representation of the term, where every node occurrence may have an associated labelled link, or ``justification pointer'', referring to some previous occurrence in the sequence. It always starts from the root of the tree and successively visits other nodes by either descending deeper into the tree structure, or jumping to other tree branches. A small set of rules formally defines how to extend a given traversal--what node to visit next with which justification pointer. This yields a prefix-closed set of justified sequences of nodes defining the set of traversals of the term.

In the typed setting, the traversal theory bears a strong connection with Game Semantics~\cite{BlumPhd}: The game denotation of a term is in bijection with the set of \emph{core projections} of its traversals (Theorem~\ref{thm:gamesem_correspondence_stlc}), where the core projection of a traversal is the subsequence obtained by keeping only occurrences that are
transitively justified by the initial node.
The set of traversals itself, on the other hand, corresponds to the game semantic denotation of a term where all the internal moves are revealed, also called ``interaction game semantics''~\cite{BlumPhd}.

This correspondence gives rise to a method for finding the normal form of a simply-typed lambda term~\cite{BlumPhd,BlumGalop2008,Blum-LocalBeta2008}
where traversals explore a branches in the tree representation of the normal form. The underlying sequences of nodes and pointers encode the unfolding of the normalization procedure over branches of the normal form. There are two kinds of nodes: the \emph{internal} nodes record intermediate steps of the reduction procedure, while \emph{external} nodes represent actual nodes from the tree representation of the normal form. The core projection acts as a `garbage collector' that removes all the internal nodes from the traversals,  yielding a path in the abstract syntax tree of the normal form.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Overview}
This paper
(i) Generalizes the notion of traversals from the typed setting, which we refer to as `\emph{concrete traversals}', to the untyped lambda calculus (ULC), which we name `\emph{imaginery traversals}';
(ii) Introduces a method to evaluate untyped lambda terms based on enumerating traversals;
(iii) Formalizes the relation between traversals and the notion of \emph{head linear reduction}.

The key idea of imaginary traversals is the ad-hoc use of eta-expansion. Attempting to traverse an untyped lambda term with concrete rules causes the traversal to get stuck when the operator sub-term of an application has insufficiently many operands. In such a situation, there is no operand node in the term tree to traverse. Take the untyped term $M = (\lambda f.f)(\lambda x.x)$ for example. A concrete traversal gives the sequence of nodes $\lambda f \cdot f \cdot \lambda x \cdot x$ (where pointers are omitted), at which point the traversal is stuck because there is no subterm representing the first argument of the variable occurrence $f$.
Similarly, a concrete traversal of $U = (\lambda x. x x)(\lambda y. y)$ gets you stuck at variable $y$ (See Example~\ref{examp:baby}). To take an analogy with abstract machine evaluators, this would be like a broken implementation of a Krivine machine~\cite{Krivine2007} attempting to lookup a variable from an empty environment, or a SECD machine~\cite{landin-secd} attempting to pop an argument from an empty stack when evaluating the application operator.

This situation never occurs in the typed setting where traversal rules conveniently assume that the lambda term is \emph{eta-long expanded}, yielding well-defined traversal rules. Eta-long expansion recursively eta-expands the subterms with respect to their type. In ULC, where types are absent, this is not feasible. Untyped terms admitting a simple type, like $M$, can be traversed via eta-long expansion with respect to the type they inhabit. But terms with no simple types, like $U$ cannot. For $U$, it turns out that eta-expanding all its variable occurrences is sufficient to unblock concrete traversals. But this does not always work: in order to traverse the term
$(\lambda x y s z. x\, s (y\, s\, z) (\lambda s z . s z))$
from Example~\ref{examp:churchincrement}, nested eta-expansions are necessary: some variables resulting from an eta-expansion need to be eta-expanded themselves! Eta-expanding all variables infinitely often is not feasible, so instead, imaginary traversal eta-expand ``on-demand''.

In the term $M$, an imaginary traversal traverses node $x$ by jumping to a fictitious fresh node $y$ that would exist if $f$ were eta-expanded
as $\lambda y.f\, y$. This trick allows the traversal to proceed with the usual traversal rules; until reaching that fictitious node $y$.
A second eta-expansion, this time of the term itself to
$\lambda z. (\lambda f y.f\, y)(\lambda x.x) z$,
unblocks the traversal, until it reaches node $z$, at which point we have a maximal traversal per the concrete traversal rules. The final traversal of the eta-expanded term is given by the sequence $\lambda z \cdot @ \cdot \lambda f y \cdot f \cdot \lambda x \cdot x \cdot \lambda \cdot y \cdot \lambda \cdot z$, where `@` represents the application node in the AST, and the dummy lambda `$\lambda$' is syntactic sugar which can be ignored for now.

Generalizing this idea, the concrete traversal rules induce an implicit `eta-expansion strategy' that imaginary ULC traversals
 implement: at any given point where concrete traversals get stuck, among all possible subterms to eta-expand, there is only one that exhibits nodes necessary for the traversal to resume.
In the above example, the first expansion considered is that of $f$ because at that point, the concrete rules only lets us
visit an immediate argument of $f$. If instead we were to eta-expand the term itself, it would yield $\lambda z. (\lambda f .f)(\lambda x.x) z$
which a concrete traversal cannot traverse since $f$ does not have an immediate argument. More intuitively: at $x$ the traversal has figured out that the subterm $\lambda x.x$ should be substituted for variable $f$, therefore to determine what $x$ should be substituted for, it needs to look for the first argument of $f$. Since $f$ has no direct argument, it must be eta-expanded. In this simple example, the jump into the realm of fictitious nodes is indefinite: nodes subsequently traversed are all absent from the original term. There are situations, however, where it eventually leads to traversing an actual node from the original term tree. Example~\ref{ex:missingoperand} illustrates this phenomenon on term $(\lambda u . u(y_1\, u)) (\lambda v . v\, y_2)$.

In practice, it is not necessary to rewrite the term or alter its syntax representation to traverse it. The eta-expansion occurs fictitiously and ``on the fly'' as the traversal unfolds, and takes place when traversing a variable node. An untyped traversal, however, bares sufficient traces of those successive fictitious eta-expansions for one to reconstruct the expanded term effectively being traversed.

When traversing a free variable, a non-deterministic choice of `argument index' can be made to decide which variable argument to traverse next.
In ULC, this index is unbounded: if it is greater than the number of arguments directly applied to the variable then a fictitious eta-expansion takes place. Evaluating an untyped term then boils down to enumerating its imaginary traversals. Although this set may be infinite, we only need to consider an effectively computable subset with sufficiently enough traversals to cover all paths of the tree representation of the beta-normal form, if it exists. We achieve this by restricting the non-determinism: we bound the argument index  by a critical quantity called `arity threshold', calculated in linear time from the traversal itself.
This quantity defines the number of arguments beyond which eta-expansions becomes unnecessary for the sake of finding a path in the normal form. This restricts both the breadth and depth of the traversal enumeration: only a finite number of on-the-fly eta-expansions are applied on a given traversal; and a traversal cannot unfold infinitely, provided that the term has a beta-normal form.

The read-out phase of the algorithm appeals to a path-correspondence property to extract from the traversals, paths of the normal form term tree. In the above example, traversal $t$ yields the path $\lambda z \cdot z$. And since the term has a single traversal, its beta-normal form is $\lambda z. z$, up to variable renaming.

 To prove correctness of the evaluation procedure, we show that traversals essentially implement a recursive version of \emph{head linear reduction}, a non-standard reduction strategy based on an alternative notion of redex
  where substitution occurs one variable occurrence at a time.

 We have implemented the evaluation procedure in HOG, a software program to study the theory of traversals as well as higher-order pushdown automata generated from Higher-Order Grammars and lambda terms~\cite{BlumGalop2008,Blum-HogTool}.  Section~\ref{sec:examples} illustrates the evaluation procedure and includes traversals that were generated with this tool when traversing untyped lambda terms.

\subsection{Related work}

\subsubsection{Theory of Traversals}

The original paper on the theory of traversals concerns higher-order recursion schemes and therefore does not deal with free variables of higher-order rank~\cite{OngLics2006}. In~\cite{BlumPhd} we extended the theory to the simply-typed lambda calculus and added traversal rule to model free variables. Both settings assume that the term or grammar is in eta-long form to guarantee that the operand of an application always exists.
In the untyped setting, eta-long expansion would be an infinite process, so instead traversals must operate on the unmodified term tree.
The present paper achieves this by eta-expanding subterms `on-the-fly' when there is insufficiently many operands in an application to continue the traversal. The term itself does not get altered: a traversal instantiates fictitious ``ghost'' nodes that would exist if the term were to be eta-expanded.
% and the traversal rules handle those fictitious nodes created in these ad-hoc eta-expansions.
When restricted to simply-typed terms, the two notions of traversal conveniently coincide (Proposition~\ref{prop:ulc_and_stlc_trav_coincide}).

In the STLC, traversals were shown to correspond to the \emph{interaction game semantic denotation}, where all internal moves from strategy composition are revealed; while the standard game denotation was shown to correspond to the set of traversals `\emph{projected with respect to the tree root}', or also called `traversal cores'. Such a correspondence induces an evaluation method for simply-typed lambda-terms in eta-long form~\cite{BlumPhd,BlumGalop2008,Ong-NormByTrav2015} that was implemented in~\cite{Blum-HogTool}, and which we state in Algorithm~\ref{algo:ulc_normalization_by_traversals}. This paper generalizes this procedure to the untyped lambda calculus, based on a variant of the traversal core operation involving relabelling of lambda nodes. A notable improvement is that it produces the traditional beta-normal form rather than the beta-\emph{eta-long} normal form. Another difference is that we prove soundness of the procedure through a connection with \emph{head-linear reduction} rather than appealing to Game Semantics.

\subsubsection{Head linear reduction}
Danos \etal established the first connection between Game Semantics and the concept of \emph{head linear reduction} for simply-typed lambda terms in eta-long form~\cite{danosherbelinregnier1996}. It was was further studied in the context of untyped lambda terms in~\cite{danos-head}. The \emph{pointer abstract machine} (PAM) provides a virtual machine implementation of head linear reduction that yields the ``\emph{quasi-head normal form (qhn)}'' of the term. To obtain the normal form itself, the resulting term further needs to be reduced to head normal form (via head reduction), and then normalized using standard normal reduction.

Like the PAM, the imaginary traversals implement head-linear reduction, but in a recursive fashion so as to fully evaluate the term to its final normal form.
A notion that we formalize as the \emph{leftmost linear reduction} strategy, that recursively applies head linear reduction; just like how the \emph{normal reduction} of the lambda calculus proceeds by recursively applying head reduction.
A traversal starts, in a `leftmost-order'-like fashion, with a depth-first search for \emph{head occurrence} of the `\emph{hoc redex}' as defined by Danos-Regnier. It performs linear substitution by ``jumping'' to the node in the tree representing the sub-term to be substituted for that head occurrence.
To find that node, traversals implement what Danos \etal call ``the gymnastics to find the argument of a subterm''~\cite{danos-head} via the mechanism of `weaving' (Proposition~\ref{prop:weaving}),
where a traversal repeatedly traverses ghost lambda and variable nodes until the node representing the argument to be fetched materializes.
The link label `$|\alpha|+i-|m|$' from the definition
of the lambda rule in Table~\ref{tab:normalizing_trav_rules} effectively calculates the quantity $r-a+l$ that appear in step 2.(b) of the PAM transition from~\cite{danos-head}.
After performing such a jump, a traversal continues its descent to look for the next head occurrence, as if that first head occurrence had been replaced by the redex argument; until it finds the variable that will become the head variable in the normal form. At this point, a PAM would stop, whereas a traversal forks  non-deterministically and recursively traverses every possible argument of the head variable.

A property of head-linear reduction is that all the terms appearing in the reduction sequence consist of sub-terms of the original term.
Both the PAM and traversals exploit this property via systems of pointers to avoid the traditional notions of environments or closures when (linearly) reducing a term.

\subsubsection{Berezun-Jones traversals}

Daniil Berezun and Neil Jones were first to introduce a notion of traversals for the untyped lambda calculus~\cite{JonesBerezunLLL-PEPM17}.
Although they took inspiration from the Game Semantic traversals of~\cite{OngLics2006,BlumGalop2008}, their definition is more operational in nature and does not directly relate to the game denotation of a term. Starting from an operational semantics of the untyped lambda calculus they derive a normalization method that, very much like the traversal of~\cite{OngLics2006, BlumPhd}, proceeds by traversing some tree representation of the term.

Their notion of tree is the traditional term tree representation of a lambda term where each node refers to a token from the lambda term syntax, whereas the present paper uses a more compressed form of tree where consecutive lambdas nodes, or consecutive applications nodes, are merged into a single bulk node. Unlike the original definition of traversals, involving eta-long transformation prior to traversing a term, neither Berezun-Jones' traversals nor imaginary traversals require any prior syntactic transformation of the input term.

Berezun-Jones' traversals distinctively rely on two justification pointers: each token of the traversal can have one \emph{binding pointer} as well as one \emph{control pointer}. The control pointers would be what Danos-Regnier call the ``price to pay for having no stacks or environments'' in the definition of the argument lookup transition of the Pointer Abstract Machine~\cite{danos-head}. They also involve the use of a `flag` boolean parameter associated with every token of the traversal.
In contrast, imaginary traversals necessitate a single justification pointer per node occurrence.

Another notable difference is that the normalization algorithm of Berezun-Jones requires a single traversal of the term. Our algorithm, on the other hand, produces one traversal for every possible maximal path in the tree representation of the beta-normal form. Each branching point in the traversal enumeration corresponds to some occurrence of a variable in the normal form, where each branch corresponds to some operand of that variable. This non-deterministic branching may conceivably be eliminated using auxiliary pointers to implement backtracking: once a variable operand is fully evaluated, the traversal would return to that variable node and start exploring remaining operands.

Their `read-out' procedure to reconstruct the normal form, shared by Berezun and Jones in a private correspondence, involves recursively applying rewriting rules to the traversal. In contrast, our read-out algorithm reconstructs the the normal form from the tree-paths extracted from the maximal traversals.

The connection between the two presentations lies in their respective correspondence with head-linear reduction: we have shown that imaginary traversals essentially implement the recursive application of the head-linear reduction. Berezun and Jones claim that a similar correspondence hold for their notion of traversal.

\subsubsection{Lambda term evaluation}
The evaluation procedure presented in this paper contrasts with term rewriting approaches that gradually transform and refine some representation of the term until reaching a normal form. In particular, it does not involve the ``capture-avoiding'' substitution used in the standard definition of beta reduction to avoid variable capture when reducing redexes. Other reduction methods exist in the literature with the same property such as combinators, Lamping's graphs, or their variant based on the geometry of interaction~\cite{Lamping:1989:AOL:96709.96711, Gonthier:1992:GOL:143165.143172, curry_combinatorylogic, Barendregt84, the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages}.
Just like those methods, variable names are not essential to the reduction procedure: traversals have explicit justification pointers from which variable bindings are entirely recoverable; variable names in Lamping's graphs are recoverable from their corresponding binding lambda;
Krivine and PAM machines encode names with De Bruijn indices
and combinators removes variables altogether through \emph{abstraction elimination}.
Just like graph-based reduction, the traversal reduction procedure involves a final ``read-back'' phase to reconstruct the resulting normal form: all the explored tree branches are assembled together to form the tree representation of the normal form. Those other reduction methods do not typically rely on eta-expansion, on the other hand they require transforming the term into some intermediate structure, such as a combinator expression or an interaction net, whereas traversals operate directly on the abstract syntax tree of the term. Unlike Lamping's graphs, traversal-based reduction is not optimal in Levy's sense~\cite{optimal-reduction-levy}.

The relationship of traversals with proof-nets and the Geometry of Interaction (GoI) can perhaps be seen through the lenses of head-linear reduction, which they implement, or their correspondence with game semantics. In particular, the linear substitution performed by traversals corresponds to firing of an exponential branch of a proof-net~\cite{MASCARI1994111}. We can also point to the work of Danos and Regnier who established the connection with abstract machines and GoI~\cite{danosherbelinregnier1996}.

\subsection{Rest of the paper}

The next section introduces basic definitions from the traversal theory. Section~\ref{sec:imaginary_traversals} defines the notion of \emph{imaginary traversals} for the untyped lambda calculus. We present in Section~\ref{sec:normalizing_trav} the reduction procedure for untyped lambda terms, and walk through examples in Section~\ref{sec:examples}. In Section~\ref{sec:leftmostlinearred}, we present \emph{head linear} and \emph{leftmost linear reduction}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:correctness_ulc_normalization} shows correctness of the evaluation procedure.


\section{Terms, trees and justified sequences}
\label{sec:basic_def}
\subsection{Notations}
\emph{Sequences:} For any alphabet $\Sigma$ we write $\Sigma^*$ to denote the set of (possibly infinite) sequences over elements of $\Sigma$.
 We use the abbreviation $\overline{x}$ for the sequence of elements $x_1 \ldots x_n$ for some $n\geq0$.

 \emph{Labelled trees:} Given a set of labels $\mathcal{L}$, the expression `$l\langle t_1, \ldots, t_m \rangle$' for $m \geq 0$ denotes a $\mathcal{L}$-labelled tree with root labelled $l\in \mathcal{L}$. The case $m=0$ represents a leaf, and otherwise a node labelled $l$ with $m$ ordered children trees $t_1$, \ldots, $t_m$. We will sometimes use the formal definition of a labelled-tree as a partial function $\nat^* \rightarrow \mathcal{L}$ mapping directed tree-paths to labels in $\mathcal{L}$, where a directed path is the sequence of child indices to follow from the tree root to a given node or leaf.

We consider the set of terms $\Lambda$ of the untyped lambda calculus (ULC) constructed from the grammar $\Lambda := x\ |\ (\Lambda\, \Lambda)\ |\ \lambda x. \Lambda $
where $x$ ranges over a countable set of variable names $\VarSet$.
For conciseness we abbreviate consecutive lambda abstractions when writing lambda terms, so that $\lambda x_1 \ldots \lambda x_n . M$ for some $n\geq 0$ and term $M$ will be written $\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n . M$; or just
$\lambda \overline{x} . M$ if $\overline{x} = x_1 \ldots x_n$.
We will also drop brackets, and assume left-associative application so that $U\,V\,W$ means $(U\,V)\,W$. We write $M \alphaequiv N$ to denote that $M$ and $N$ are equal up to variable renaming.
In the rest of the paper, we use uppercase letters $M, N, T, U, V$ for lambda terms and lowercase $x,y,z$ to denote variables. Terms will all have variable names ranging in some fixed set $\VarSet$ of identifiers.

We recall standard results of the lambda calculus.
A \defname{redex} is a sub-term of the form $(\lambda x. M) N$.
Reducing redex $(\lambda x. M) N$, or also \emph{firing} the redex, means substituting all free occurrences of $x$ in $M$ by the term $N$ using capture avoiding substitution (the bound variable is renamed afresh when recursively substituting under a lambda).
A term is said to be in \defname{normal form} if it does not contain any redex.
A term is in \defname{head normal form} if it can be written $\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n . y A_1 \ldots A_m$ for $n,m\geq0$. If a term is not in head normal form then its \defname{head beta-redex} is the left-most redex, otherwise the term does not have any head beta-redex. For any reduction relation $\rightarrow$ between terms we will write $\rightarrow^*$ to denote its reflexive transitive closure. The \defname{eta-expansion} of $M$ refers to some term $\lambda x. M x $ for some variable $x$ fresh in $M$.

The \defname{head reduction}, denoted $\rightarrow_{h}$, fires the head redex of a term if it exists. It can be shown that $\rightarrow^*_{h}$ yields the head-normal form. The \defname{normal-order reduction strategy}, also called leftmost-outermost reduction strategy, performs head reduction until reaching the head-normal form and then recursively applies head reduction on each operand of the head variable. A standard result is that this reduction strategy yields the normal form if it exists.

\paragraph{Types} Simple types are generated from the grammar $\tau := o\, | \tau \rightarrow \tau$ where $o$ ranges over a fixed set of atomic types. Typed-annotated lambda-terms are generated from the grammar $E := \VarSet\, |\, (E\, E)\, |\, \lambda \VarSet \colon\tau. E $.
We write $M^\tau$ to denote a closed (\ie, no free variable)
type-annotated lambda-term typable with the judgement rules of the simply-typed lambda calculus~\cite{Barendregt84} and $M$ to denote the untyped term obtained by erasing all the type annotations.

\subsection{Computation tree and enabling relation}

Given an untyped lambda term $M$ we define its \defname{computation tree} as an abstract syntax tree representation
(AST) of the term where consecutive lambda abstractions are merged into a single `bulk' lambda-node and consecutive applications are represented by a single application node whose first child represents the operator, and subsequent children represents the operands.
This definition is similar to that of STLC~\cite{OngLics2006, BlumPhd} with the notable difference that we do not eta-long expand the term prior to constructing the computation tree.
\begin{definition}
The \defname{computation tree} $\ctree(M)$ of an
 untyped lambda term $M$ is a $\mathcal{L}$-labelled tree
with labels
$\mathcal{L} = \{ @ \} \union \VarSet \union \{ \lambda x_1 \ldots x_n \ | \ x_1 ,\ldots, x_n \in
    \VarSet, n\in\nat \}$
defined inductively by:
\begin{align*}
    \ctree(\lambda \overline{x} . z s_1 \ldots s_m) &= \lambda \overline{x}\; \langle\; z\; \langle \ctree(s_1),\ldots,\ctree(s_m)\rangle\rangle
&    \hbox{for $m\geq 0$, $z \in \VarSet$},
\\
\ctree(\lambda \overline{x} . (\lambda y.t) s_1 \ldots s_m) &= \lambda \overline{x}\; \langle\; @ \; \langle \ctree(\lambda y.t),\ctree(s_1),\ldots,\ctree(s_m) \rangle \rangle \enspace
&  \hbox{for $m\geq 1$, $y\in \VarSet$}.
\end{align*}

Note that any lambda term can indeed be written in one of the two forms above. In particular, applicative terms are handled by the case $n=0$ of the form $\lambda . N$ for some term $N$ where `$\lambda$' is referred to as a ``dummy lambda''.

The computation tree is just a more compact version of the traditional notion of term tree from the lambda calculus. One advantage is that application nodes indicate the presence of beta-redexes in the term.
With the implicit generalization of the above definition to infinitary terms,
computation trees without @-nodes are isomorphic to B\"ohm tree~\cite{Barendregt84}.
Another property of this representation is the \defname{alternation} between lambda nodes and variable/application nodes at odd and even levels.

We write $\Nodes(M)$ to denote the set of nodes of $\ctree(M)$, or just $\Nodes$ if the term is clear from context; $\NodesVar$ for the set of variable nodes; $\NodesLmd$ for lambda nodes, and $\NodesApp$ for  application nodes. For any lambda node $\alpha\in\NodesLmd$ we write $\child(\alpha)$ to denote its unique child node (either a variable node or $@$).
\end{definition}

We define the \defname{enabling relation} $\enables$ on tree nodes $\Nodes$ as the relation mapping (i) each lambda node to all the variable nodes that it binds; (ii) the root of the tree to all the free variable nodes; (iii) variable and application node to each one of their child node. We write $n \enables_k \lambda\overline{x}$, for $k\geq0$, to indicate that a lambda node $\lambda\overline{x}$ is the $k$th child of a variable or application node $n$; $\lambda\overline{x} \enables_k n$, for $k\geq1$, to indicate that the label of a bound variable node $n$ is precisely the name of the $k$th variable bound by  $\lambda\overline{x}$ , that is $n=x_k$; and if $r$ denotes the root of the tree then we take the convention $r \enables_k z$ for any free variable node $z$, where $k$ denotes the free variable index of $z$ according to some predefined numbering of free variables.
We say that node $m$ \defname{hereditarily enables} $n$ if they relate by the reflexive transitive closure of $\enables$.

Because variable names and bindings are entirely recoverable from the enabling relation, the notion of computation tree could equivalently be defined as a name-free tree over three node labels $\{ \lambda, {\sf Var}, @ \}$ indicating the `type' of each node, together with the enabling relation.

A tree node is \defname{external} if it is hereditarily enabled by the root, otherwise it is \defname{internal}. We write $\ExternalNodes$ for the set of external nodes, that is the image of the tree root by the reflexive transitive closure of the enabling relation. Internal nodes are therefore precisely the nodes hereditarily justified by application nodes $@$. We write $\InternalNodes$ to denote the set of internal nodes.
The \defname{arity} of a node $n$, written $|n|$,
is defined for a variable node as the number of immediate arguments (\ie, children in the computation tree); for an application node, as the number of operands (\ie, number of children of the $@$-node minus 1); for a lambda node $\lambda x_1 \cdots x_k$, $k\geq 0$, as the number of bound variables $k$.

\subsection{Extensional computation tree}
We extend the notion of computation tree by augmenting the
 \defname{structural nodes} $\Nodes$, representing tokens in the syntax representation of the lambda term,
with two countable sets of \defname{ghost nodes} representing fictitious tokens: The \emph{ghost lambda nodes}
represent fictitious lambda abstractions,
whereas \emph{ghost variable nodes} represent fictitious
occurrences of variables bound by either a structural or a ghost lambda node.

We simultaneously define ghost nodes and extend the enabling relation $\enables$ recursively as follows: for every (ghost) variable or application node $n$ with parent (ghost) lambda-node $\alpha$, and for all $k>|n|$, we define two new unique ghost nodes $\ghostlmd$ and $\ghostvar$
such that
$\ghostvar$ is the unique child of $\ghostlmd$, itself defined as the $k$th-child of $n$;
and we extend the enabling relation with $n \enables_k \ghostlmd$
and $\alpha \enables_{|\alpha|+ k} \ghostvar$; where by convention ghost nodes have arity $0$, and the arity of structural nodes remains unchanged (\ie, given by their arity in the computation tree without ghost nodes).
This enabling relation induces a binding relationship, between ghost variables and their (possibly ghost) lambda-node binder, which permits us to forgo the notion of variables names in ghost nodes: we will thus
use respectively $\ghostlmd$ and $\ghostvar$ as a unique label for all ghost lambda and variable nodes. We also omit ghost nodes when illustrating computation trees.

We call the tree hereby defined the \defname{extensional computation tree} of $M$,
denoted $\exttree(M)$ over the \defname{extended nodes} $\ExtendedNodes = \Nodes + \ghostvar + \ghostlmd$, where $+$ denotes disjoint union on sets. We use the shorthands $\ExtendedNodesLmd$ for $\NodesLmd + \ghostlmd$ and $\ExtendedNodesVar$ for $\NodesVar + \ghostvar$.

\subsection{Justified sequence of nodes}
\label{sec:justseq}

A \defname{justified sequence} is defined a sequence of nodes in $\ExtendedNodes$ where every occurrence $n$ in the sequence may have an associated link called `justification pointer' pointing to some previous node occurrence $j$ in the sequence, called its `justifier', with an associated `link label' $l\geq0$; with the constraint that the justifier node $\enables$-enables the source node with the corresponding label; that is $j \enables_l n$ must hold. We represent a justified sequence as a sequence of labelled node occurrences with back-pointing arrows representing justification pointers, for example: $\Pstr[10pt]{ s = \cdots (j){j} \ldots (n-j,25:l){n} }$ which we read `$n$ points to $j$', or `$n$ is justified by $j$' with link label $l$.
For readability, we sometimes indicate the link label in exponent of the justified occurrence instead of above the pointer, or even omit the justification pointers altogether.
Note that the enabling relation is \emph{statically} induced by the tree structure whereas the concept of justification is defined on node \emph{occurrences}, that is within a specific justified sequence. The set $\justseqset(M)$ of justified sequences over $M$ consists of all justified sequences over the extended nodes $\ExtendedNodes$.


The (name-free) \defname{structure} of a justified sequence refers to the sequence obtained by discarding node labels while preserving node types. It is encoded as a sequence of triples $\{\lambda, {\sf Var}, @ \}\times\nat\times\nat$ where the first component indicates the type of each occurrence (lambda bunch, variable, application), the second component indicates the link distance, and the third component is the link label ($0$ for no pointer).
Two sequences $s$ and $u$ over possibly two distinct terms are \defname{equivalent}, written $s \equiv u$ just if they have the same structure: the types of the underlying nodes in the two sequences match pairwise (either both variable/@ nodes or both lambda nodes) and have the same justification pointers. Two equivalent sequences are not necessarily equal since they may have different variable names.
We say that two subsets $J_1\subseteq \justseqset(M_1)$ and $J_2\subseteq\justseqset(M_2)$ are isomorphic, written $J_1\cong J_2$, if  there exists a structure-preserving bijection between $J_1$ and $J_2$. That is there exists a bijection $\phi :J_1\longrightarrow J_2$ such that for any $j\in J$, $j\equiv\phi(j)$.

The \defname{quadruplet encoding} of a justified sequence of nodes with variables in $\VarSet$ is a sequence of quadruplets in $O_4 = \nat^*\times \mathcal{V}^* \times\nat\times\nat$ defined occurrence-wise where each quadruplets $(n,p,j,i) \in O_4$ is such that the \emph{Node path} $n$ encodes the path to the node in the extensional computation tree, which uniquely defines the type and label of the occurrence;
the \emph{Pending lambdas} $p$ is the empty list $\epsilon$;
the \emph{Link distance} $j$ is the number of occurrences separating the occurrence from its justifier plus $1$, or $0$ for no justifier;
the \emph{Link label} $i$ is the label of the justification pointer.

This initial encoding is said to be \defname{canonical} because the \emph{pending lambda} components are all empty. We will define subsequent transformations that alter the pending lambda components.
Observe that given a fixed term, a canonical justified sequence encoding uniquely determines its structure, by just discarding the labels; and reciprocally, labels are uniquely recoverable from the sequence structure and the term's enabling relation.

\emph{Decoding a quadruplet sequence} When interpreting a quadruplet sequence as a justified sequence, the variables from the `pending lambdas' get appended to the list of variables bound by the corresponding lambda nodes. When typesetting a sequence from $\justseqset(M)$, we represent occurrences by their associated node labels and represent the \emph{pending lambdas} in exponent. For example in the sequence $\cdots @ \cdot x \cdot \lambda\overline{x}^{[y_1 \ldots y_n]} \cdots$, $\lambda\overline{x}$ is the label of the tree node associated with that occurrence and $y_1 \ldots y_n$ are the \emph{pending lambdas} for this occurrence. We omit the exponent if the list of pending lambdas is empty.

We adopt the quadruplet encoding throughout the rest of the paper and thus assume $\justseqset(M)$ to be a (strict) subset of $O_4^*$.
%
% Observe that not every member of $\justseqset(M)$ corresponds to a valid justified sequence of $M$; but if it does then it's uniquely defined up to the equality relation Eq.
%
% They provide a tagging mechanism to alter the names of the binding variables in lambda node occurrences.
%
% It will only be used for nodes of lambda type; for other nodes it will always be the empty list.

\begin{example}
\label{examp:ghost_materialization}
    Let $M = \lambda x. (\lambda y z.z) u$. The structural paths of the computation tree of $M$ are $\Sigma = \{\epsilon, 0, 00,000, 01,010\}$. The justified sequence
    $\Pstr[10pt]{
        (l){\lambda x} \cdot (a)@ \cdot (lyz-a,25:0){\lambda y z} \cdot (z-lyz,25:2)z \cdot (gl-a,30:2)\ghostlmd \cdot (gv-l,32:2)\ghostvar }
    $
    has quadruplet encoding
    $(\epsilon, \epsilon ,0,0), (0,\epsilon,0,0), (00, \epsilon, 1,0), (000,\epsilon, 1,2), (02,\epsilon,3,2), (020,\epsilon,5,2) $ whereas the quadruplets $ (\epsilon, g ,0,0), (0,\epsilon,0,0), (00, h~k, 1,0), (000,\epsilon, 1,2), (02,\epsilon,3,2), (020,\epsilon,5,2) $ encode the justified sequence
    $\Pstr[10pt]{
        (l){\lambda x^{[g]}} \cdot (a)@ \cdot (lyz-a,25:0){\lambda y z^{[h~k]}} \cdot (z-lyz,25:2)z \cdot (gl-a,30:2)\ghostlmd \cdot (gv-l,31:2)\ghostvar }
    $.
\end{example}

We say that two justified sequences are \defname{equal} if their underlying canonical encodings have the same structure and variable names. Formally, for two terms $M$ and $N$ we define the relation
$Eq_{M,N} \subseteq O_4(N) \times O_4(M)$ as $(n,\overline{p},d,k)~Eq_{M,N}~(n',\overline{p'},d',k')$
just if  $n$ and $n'$ have the same type, $d = d'$, $k = k'$, and if $n$ and $n'$ are labelled $\lambda\overline{x}$ and $\lambda\overline{x'}$ respectively then $\overline{x} \cdot \overline{p} = \overline{x'} \cdot \overline{p'}$.
% Definition expanded on multiple lines
% \begin{align*}
% (n,\overline{p},d,k)~Eq_{M,N}~(n',\overline{p'},d',k') &\iff
% \begin{cases}
%     n \mbox{ and $n'$ have the same type} \\
%     d = d' \\
%     k = k' \\
%     \mbox{If $n=\lambda\overline{x}$ and $n'=\lambda\overline{y}$ then
%         $\overline{x} \cdot \overline{p} = \overline{y} \cdot \overline{p'}$.
%     }
% \end{cases}
% \end{align*}
The reflexive closure of $Eq_{M,N}^*$ defines an equivalence relation on
 the disjoint union $O_4(M) + O_4(N)$, and by occurrence-wise extension, $Eq_{M,N}^*$ defines an equivalence relation on $\justseqset(M) + \justseqset(N)$.
 We will consider equality of occurrences and justified sequences according to this relation.  Given variable names $\overline{x}$ and $\overline{y}$, we will write interchangeably $\lambda\overline{x}^{[\overline{y}]}$ or $\lambda\overline{x}\overline{y}$.

 Pending lambdas provide a convenient way to interpret justified sequences over two distinct terms (\eg, before and after firing a redex).
 \begin{example}
    Alpha-conversion does not alter the structure of a sequence, so for instance we have $\Pstr[10pt]{ (l){\lambda x y} \cdot (n-l,25){x} } \equiv \Pstr[10pt]{ (l){\lambda z y} \cdot (n-l,25){z}}$. The number of variable bindings in a lambda node may also change without impacting its structure, as long as justification link labels are unaffected, so we also have $\Pstr[10pt]{ (l){\lambda x y z w t} \cdot (n-l,25){x} } \equiv \Pstr[10pt]{ (l){\lambda x} \cdot (n-l,25){x}}$ since the structure of both sequences is $(\lambda,0)\cdot({\sf Var},1)$.
\end{example}

We will use non-canonical encodings to implement a form of $\beta$-reduction on  justified sequences, where the \emph{pending lambdas} component will provide a mechanism to combine two distinct lambda nodes in a single one, a process by which an anonymous ghost variable may materialize into a structural node with a variable name.

% lambda merging indirectly helps with node materialization since a ghost variable may get its name after merging two lambda nodes.
% This occurs when a ghost variable points to a lambda node $\lambda\overline{x}^{[\overline{y}]}$ with label $i$ strictly greater than the arity of $|x|$ but smaller than $|x|+|y|$.

%%%% TODO --- Define `pretty printing' with node materialization:
% The variable name of an occurrence of variable type is induced by the justification label together with its lambda node justifier: if a variable occurrence points to lambda node $\lambda\overline{x}$ with link label $i\leq|x|$ then the variable name is $x_i$.
%If $i>|x|$ then the variable is a ghost variable and its label is $\ghostvar$.
%%%

A justified sequence verifies the \defname{alternation condition} if the first node is a lambda node and subsequent nodes occurrences alternate between (i) a variable or application node (ii) a lambda node.
A node occurrence in a justified sequence is \defname{hereditarily justified by some other occurrence} if recursively following justification pointers starting from the first occurrence in the sequence leads to the second one. Because justification pointers must honor the enabling relation $\enables$ induced by the term structure, if an occurrence of node $n$ is hereditarily justified by occurrence of a node $m\in\Nodes$ then $n$ is necessarily hereditarily enabled by $m$. Further if $m$ occurs only once in the justified sequence then the occurrences hereditarily justified by $m$ are precisely the occurrences of nodes that are hereditarily \emph{enabled} by $m$.

Let $s$ denote a justified sequence.
We write $s^\omega$ to denote the last occurrence of $s$. For any occurrence $n$ in $s$ we write $s_{\leq n}$ for the prefix of $s$ ending at $n$, and $s_{<n}$ for the prefix ending immediately before $n$.
%and $\jp(s)$ to denote the prefix of $s$ ending at the justifier of the last node of $s$.
We say that $s$ \defname{extends} $u$ if $u$ is a strict prefix of $s$.

We borrow some standard operations on justified sequences from Game Semantics~\cite{Abr02}.
\begin{definition}[Projections]
Let $n$ be some occurrence of a justified sequence $s$. The \defname{projection} $s\filter n$ of $s$ with respect to $n$ is the subsequence obtained by keeping only occurrences hereditarily justified by $n$ in $s$. For a subset $A$ of nodes in $\Nodes$ we write $s \filter A$ to denote the subsequence of $s$ consisting of occurrences of nodes in $A$ only.

We will consider the subsequence $s\filter\ExternalNodes$ consisting of external nodes of $s$, which is equivalently given by $s\filter r_1 \filter \ldots \filter r_n$ where $r_1, \ldots r_n$, $n\geq 1$ are the occurrences of the root in $s$.
\end{definition}

The P-view is the sub-sequence obtained by reading a justified sequence backwards and following the justification pointer every other node: if the last node is a variable node then follow its justification pointer (\ie, skip all the occurrences lying underneath); if it is a lambda node then move to the preceding node. Formally:
\begin{definition}[Views]
\label{def:views}
The P-view $\pview{s}$ of a justified sequence $s$ is defined recursively by:
$$\begin{array}{rcll}
 \pview{\epsilon} &=&  \epsilon \\
 \pview{s \cdot n }  &=&  \pview{s} \cdot n
    & \mbox{if $n$ is a variable or $@$ node;}
    \\
 \pview{\Pstr[10pt]{ s \cdot (m){m} \cdots (lmd-m,25){n}}} &=&
        \Pstr{ \pview{s} \cdot (m2){m} \cdot (lmd2-m2,30){n} }
    & \mbox{if $n$ is a lambda node;}
    \\
 \pview{s \cdot n }  &=&  n & \mbox{if $n$ is a lambda node with no pointer.}
\end{array}$$

We define the dual notion $\oview{s}$ of O-view by
$\oview{\epsilon} = \epsilon$;
$\oview{s \cdot n }  =  \oview{s} \cdot n$ for $\lambda$-node $n$;
$\oview{\Pstr[10pt]{s \cdot (m){m} \cdots (x-m,30){x}}}= \Pstr{ \oview{s} \cdot (m2){m} \cdot (n2-m2,45){x} }$ for variable node $x$; and $\oview{s \cdot @ } = @$.

% Expanded version of the O-View definition:
% The dual notion of O-view, denoted $\oview{s}$, is defined by:
% $$\begin{array}{rcll}
%  \oview{\epsilon} &=&  \epsilon \\
%  \oview{s \cdot n }  &=&  \oview{s} \cdot n
%     & \mbox{if $n$ is an $\lambda$-node;}
%     \\
%  \oview{\Pstr[10pt]{s \cdot (m){m} \cdot \cdots \cdot (x-m,30){n}}} &=&
%     \Pstr{ \oview{s} \cdot (m2){m} \cdot (n2-m2,60){n} }
%     & \mbox{if $n$ is a variable node;}
%     \\
%  \oview{s \cdot n }  &=&  n
%     & \mbox{if $n$ is an $@$ node.}
% \end{array}$$
\end{definition}

Given two occurrences $n$ and $m$ in a justified sequence $s$, we say that $n$ is \defname{visible at} $m$ just if $n$ occurs in the P-view $\pview{s_{\leq m}}$.

\subsection{Justified paths of the term tree}

For any term $M$ we define the \defname{set of justified paths} $\pathset(M)$ as the set of justified sequences in $\justseqset(M)$ whose underlying sequences of nodes are precisely the structural paths (\ie, without ghosts) of the labelled-tree $\ctree(M)$ and justification pointers are induced by the enabling relation as follows: Occurrence of bound variable nodes are justified by their binder node with link label determined by the variable index in the binding node; free variables are justified by the initial node in the sequence (the tree root) and their link label is an index in $\nat$ uniquely identifying the free variable name; and lambda nodes are justified by the immediate predecessor in the sequence (the parent node by by definition) with label index given by the child index. This notion is well defined because a variable binder necessarily occurs in the path from it to the root.
\begin{property}[Path Characterization]
\label{prop:tree_path_charact}
 An untyped term $M$ is uniquely determined by either
(i) the subset of maximal justified paths of $\pathset(M)$;
or (ii) the \emph{structure} of the maximal justified paths in $\pathset(M)$, up to $\alpha$-conversion.
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
(i) Computation trees are in one-to-one correspondence with the standard tree representation of a lambda term. By definition, $\pathset(M)$ is prefix-closed and thus uniquely determined by its maximal elements. (ii) Variables names are uniquely determined by the justification pointers and their associated label index.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  $\pathset((\lambda x.x y) (\lambda z.z))$ is the prefix closure of
  $\{
  \Pstr{ (r){\lambda} (at){@} (lx-at,30:0){\lambda x} (x-lx,30:1){x} (l2-x,30:1){\lambda} (y-r,40:1){y} },
  \Pstr{ (r){\lambda} (at){@} (lz-at,35:1){\lambda z} (z-lz,35:1){z}}
  \}$.
\end{example}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:termtree_readout_from_justitied_paths} shows how to reconstruct the tree from a set of justified sequences that is isomorphic to the justified paths of the term. Note how ghost variables get materialized by  assigning real variable names. Observe as well that variable nodes with same binder and same link label are assigned the same variable name. This assignment is sound since by Property~\ref{prop:tree_path_charact}, justification pointers in a justified path uniquely determine variables names.

\begin{definition}[Induced labelled-tree]
Let $T$ be a set of justified sequences of $M$ that is isomorphic to justified paths $\pathset(M_2)$ of some other term $M_2$.
Then $T$ induces the $\mathcal{L}$-labelled tree $(P,L)$
with labels $\mathcal{L} = \ExtendedNodes \times P \times \nat$.
The set of directed paths $P \subseteq \nat^*$ are \emph{generated} from justified sequences in $T$: variable occurrences and application node have child index $1$; the child index of lambda-node occurrences is given by their justification label.
The label function $L : P \rightarrow\mathcal{L}$ is defined for
any path $p\in P$, generated from some sequence $s = s' \cdot n$ of $T$,
as follows: if $n$ has no justifier then $L(p) = (n, p, 0)$; otherwise $L(p) = (n, b, i)$ where $b$ is the prefix of $p$ corresponding to $n$'s justifier and $i$ is the label of $n$'s justification pointer.
\end{definition}
It is well-defined because sequences in $T$ correspond to actual paths in the tree of $M_2$, therefore any two sequences $s_1, s_2$ generating the same path $p$ must end with the same tree node with same justifier.

\subsection{Definition and properties}

\begin{definition}
The set $\travulc(M)$ of \defname{traversals} of an untyped lambda term $M$, abbreviated $\travulc$ when the term is clear from context, is the set of justified sequences of nodes over the extensional computation tree of $M$, recursively defined by the rules of Table~\ref{tab:trav_rules}.

We will use interchangeably `\emph{ULC traversal}', `\emph{imaginary traversal}' or just `\emph{traversal}' when referring to a traversal of an untyped term.
\end{definition}

\end{table}

\begin{example}
\label{ex:ulctrav_sample}
An example of traversal of the term $(\lambda u . u(y_1\,u)) (\lambda v . v\,y_2)$, whose computation tree is represented in Example~\ref{ex:missingoperand}, is
$\Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda}
\,(n1){@}

\,(n17-n0,28){y_2}} \in \travset$.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:ulctrav_welldefined_pathview}
The traversal rules are well defined, in particular for any sequence of nodes with pointers $t\in \travset$ we have:
\begin{compactitem}
\item[(i)] The sequence $t$ is a valid justified sequence, with respect to
the enabling relation $\enables$ on extended nodes $\ExtendedNodes$, and verifies the alternation condition;
%(ii) and if the last node in $t$ is external then so are all the nodes in $\oview{t}$. % By induction on \oview{t}
\item[(ii)] For all occurrences $\Pstr[0.5cm]{(m){m} \cdots (n-m,30:i){n}}$, $n$ is a ghost node if and only if $i > |m|$;
\item[(iii)] $\pview{t}$ is a (justified) path in the extensional computation tree $\exttree(M)$;
In particular, if $t$ does not contain ghost nodes then $\pview{t}$ is also structural path in $\ctree(M)$.
\end{compactitem}
\end{proposition}
\shortproof
Proven simultaneously by induction on the traversal rules.
Rule \rulenamet{Lam^{\sf var}}: By induction hypothesis (iii) the P-view is a path in the extensional computation tree of $M$. But the last node of $t$ is a structural node therefore, this path is necessarily a structural path with no ghost node. Consequently, if the last node is a bound variable node, its enabler is precisely its binding lambda node which necessarily occurs exactly once in the path to the root. If the variable is free then the enabler is the root itself: (i) holds. By definition, the justification pointer honors the enabling relation so (ii) holds. The node $n$ is by definition the unique child of $\alpha$ thus (iii) holds.

Rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar}, the induction hypothesis (ii) shows that $i>|m|$, which guarantees that $|\beta|+i-|m|>0$ is a valid justification label (i) and that (ii) holds for the traversed node $\ghostvar$.
Finally (iii) holds because the node preceding $\ghostvar$ in the P-view is precisely $\beta$, its parent node.

Other rules are straightforward.
\endshortproof

The last property generalizes a result from the theory of traversals for higher-order grammars~\cite{OngLics2006} and simply-typed lambda terms~\cite[Proposition 4.29]{BlumPhd} to the untyped setting: The game-semantic concept of P-views from Definition~\ref{def:views} corresponds to paths in the computations tree.

% For any $t\in \travset$, the sequences $t\filter\ExternalNodes$ is a valid justified sequences verifying the alternation condition.


\paragraph{On-the-fly eta-expansion}
It is the variable rules \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{IVar} that perform `on-the-fly expansion'. When the variable arity is high enough, the tree statically dictates the structural node to traverse next: we have $i \leq |m|$ and $\alpha$ is a structural lambda node in $\NodesLmd$; we call this the \emph{concrete sub-case}. Otherwise, the variable arity is too low to statically determine the operand of an application: $i > |m|$ and $\alpha$ is a ghost lambda node $\ghostlmd$; we call this the \emph{eta-expanded sub-case}.

Rule \rulenamet{Lam} traverses a lambda node by just visiting its unique child  in the tree, which is necessarily a structural node. Its counterpart \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar} traverses a ghost lambda by visiting the imaginary ghost variable that would be created if we were to eta-expand the sub-term under that lambda: the ghost placeholder $\ghostvar$ represents an occurrence of the $j$th variable bound by lambda node $\beta$ if the sub-term at node $\beta$ were eta-expanded $i-|n|$ times; hence $j = |\beta| + i - |m|$.
Observe that we necessarily have $i>|n|$ since the $i$th child of $n$ is a ghost variable node.

%%% analogy
An analogy may help understand the intuition behind ghost nodes:
just like the imaginary number $i$ in mathematics was invented from the impossibility of calculating the square root of $-1$, ghost nodes are introduced from the impossibility of resolving the argument of a variable when traversing a lambda term, due to an insufficient number of operands. Ghost nodes start to appear when the arity of a variable is too low to structurally traverse it.


%%%%
Continuing with the analogy, complex numbers are sometimes used as an intermediate concept to perform some calculation, without necessarily appearing in the final result. For instance, the De Moivre's Theorem, which involves complex numbers, is often used to prove trigonometry identities on real numbers. Similarly, we use ghost nodes to evaluate lambda terms but they eventually materialize as regular nodes in the final normal form.

\begin{definition}
We call \defname{ghost materialization} any instantiation of a traversal rule where the last occurrence in the traversal prior to applying the rule is a ghost node, and the node traversed after applying the rule is a structural node.
\end{definition}
%%%%end of analogy


The underlying successive eta-expansions of $M$ can be reconstructed from the traversal itself:
\begin{definition}
\label{def:onthefly_etaexpansion}
Let $M$ be an untyped term. If $n\in \Nodes$ is the root node of some subterm $N$ of $M$ then
for $k \leq 0$ we define ${\sf ETA}(M, n, k) = M$; and for $k> 0$ we define ${\sf ETA}(M, n, k)$ as the term obtained by substituting in-place the subterm $N$ with $\lambda\theta_1 \cdots \theta_k. N \theta_1 \cdots \theta_k$ for some variables $\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_k$ fresh in $N$.

The \defname{eta-expansion of $M$ with respect to a finite traversal $t$}, written $M^t$, is defined inductively by $M^\epsilon = M$,
$M^{u \cdot n} = M$ if $n$ has no justifier, and if $m$ denotes $n$'s justifier in $u$ with link label $i$ then $M^{u \cdot n} = {\sf ETA}(M^{u}, m, i-|m|)$.
\end{definition}
As mentioned earlier, the condition  $i-|m|>0$ only holds for the eta-expanded case of rules \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{IVar}.

It follows from the definition that $M$ is a sub-tree of $M^t$ therefore paths in the tree of $M$ are also paths in the tree of $M^t$.

\begin{example}
The eta-expansion of $(\lambda u . u(y_1\,u)) (\lambda v . v\,y_2)$, with computation tree shown in Example~\ref{ex:missingoperand}, with respect to traversal $t$ from Example~\ref{ex:ulctrav_sample} is
$(\lambda u . u(y_1 (\lambda \alpha. u (\lambda \beta.\alpha\,\beta))) (\lambda v . v\,y_2)$.
\end{example}


\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:eta_expanded_trav}
Let $M$ be an untyped term and $t$ be a \emph{finite} traversal of $M$.
There exists a one-to-one function $\eta_t : \ExtendedNodes(M) \longrightarrow \ExtendedNodes(M^t)$
such that its implicit \emph{element-wise pointer-preserving} extension $\eta_t : \mathcal{J}(M) \longrightarrow \mathcal{J}(M^t)$ verifies the properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),nosep]
    \item For any $u \in \travulc(M)$, $\eta_t(u)$ is a traversal of $M^t$.
    And thus $\pview{\eta_t(u)}$ is a \emph{structural} path in the computation tree $\ctree(M^t)$.

    \item If $v$ traverses
    $M^t$ then there exists a traversal $u$ of $M$ (with possibly ghost nodes) such that $v = \eta_t(u)$.

    \item The restriction of $\eta_t$ to $\travset(M)$ defines a strong bijection with $\travset(M^t)$ (\ie, a bijection preserving the traversal structure, but not necessarily labels).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\proofatend
The tree $\ctree(M)$ being by definition a subtree of $\ctree(M^t)$, induces a one-to-one mapping from $\Nodes(M)$ to $\Nodes(M^t)$.
We extend it to ghost nodes by mapping ghost occurrences in $t$ to the corresponding node resulting from the eta-expansions of subterms of $M$ in $M^t$, and all other ghost nodes not occurring in $t$ to the corresponding ghost nodes in $\ctree(M^t)$. Formally, we define $\eta_t$ by induction on the traversal $t$, observing that the eta-expansion performed in rules \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{IVar} in Definition~\ref{def:onthefly_etaexpansion} increments the arity of the justifier node $m$, which guarantees that the corresponding structural node exists in $\ctree(M^t)$.

(i) By induction on $u$. Reusing the rule used to traverse $u$ to traverse $\eta_t(u)$. For the case \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{IVar}, when the \emph{eta-expanded} subcase of the rule is used to traverse a ghost variable that also appeared in $t$, we use instead the \emph{concrete} sub-case used to traverse $\eta_t(u)$.

(ii) By induction on $v$, applying to $u$ each rule that is applied to $v$. For the case \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{IVar}, if the index $i$ is greater than the arity of the node $m$ in $M$ then the lambda node from $v$ gets replaced by a ghost lambda node in $u$.

(iii) By (i) the function is well defined, it is injective by definition, and by (ii) it is surjective.
\endproofatend

\begin{example}
Continuing with the previous example: the following traversal obtained from $t$ is a valid traversal of $M^t$ where the occurrences corresponding to ghosts in $t$ are underlined:
$$\Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda}
\,(n1){@}
\,(n2-n1){\lambda u}
\,(n3-n2){u}
\,(n4-n1){\lambda v}
\,(n5-n4){v}\,(n6-n3){\bf \lambda}\,(n7-n0){y_1}\,(n8-n7){\bf \lambda}
\,(n9-n2){u}\,(n10-n1){\lambda v}\,(n11-n10){v}
\,(n12-n9){\underline{\lambda\beta}}\,(n13-n8){\underline{\alpha}}
\,(n14-n13){\underline{\lambda}}\,(n15-n12){\underline{\beta}}
\,(n16-n11){\lambda}\,(n17-n0,35){y_2} }.$$
\end{example}

\paragraph{Traversal core}

We now generalize the notion of \emph{traversal core} from~\cite{BlumPhd} to imaginary traversals. In the typed setting, it is defined as the subsequence of a traversal consisting of external nodes only. In the untyped setting, we complement this filtering with a relabelling operation on lambda nodes.

We consider sequences of variable names in $\VarSet^*$ as stacks equipped with the standard operations:
for any sequence of variables $\overline{x} = x_1 \ldots x_n$, $n,j\geq0$, the `pop' operation $pop_j$ removes the first $j$ elements of the sequence: $pop_j (x_1 \ldots x_n) = x_{j+1} \ldots x_n$ if $j<n$, and $pop_j (x_1 \ldots x_n) = \epsilon$ otherwise. And for any sequence $\overline{y} = y_1 \ldots y_m$, $m\geq0$ we write $\overline{x}\overline{y}$ for
$x_1 \ldots x_n y_1 \ldots y_n$, the stack obtained after pushing the variables $\overline{x}$ (read backwards) onto $\overline{y}$.


\begin{definition}[Core projection]
\label{def:coreprojection}
Let $\overline{y} \in \VarSet^*$ denote a stack of variable names.
We define the partial function $\coresymbol_{\overline{y}}\colon \justseqset(M) \longrightarrow \justseqset(M)$ by induction: $\coresymbol_{\overline{y}}(\epsilon) = \epsilon$, and for any justified sequence $s \cdot n\in\justseqset(M)$ with prefix subsequence $s$ and node $n$:
\begin{equation*}
\coresymbol_{\overline{y}}(s\cdot n) =
\begin{cases}
\coresymbol_{\epsilon}(s) \cdot n
    & \mbox{if } n\in\ExtendedNodesVar\inter\ExternalNodes, \\
\coresymbol_{pop_{|n|}(\overline{y})}(s)
    & \mbox{if } n\in(\ExtendedNodesVar\inter\InternalNodes)\union\NodesApp, \\
\coresymbol_{\epsilon}(s) \cdot \lambda \overline{x}\overline{y}
    & \mbox{if } n\in\NodesLmd\inter\ExternalNodes, n \mbox{ labelled } \lambda\overline{x},\\
\coresymbol_{\overline{x} \overline{y}}(s)
    & \mbox{if } n\in\NodesLmd\inter\InternalNodes, n \mbox{ labelled } \lambda\overline{x}, \\
\coresymbol_{\epsilon}(s) \cdot\lambda\overline{y}
    & \mbox{if } n\in\ghostlmd\inter\ExternalNodes, \\
\coresymbol_{\overline{y}}(s)
    & \mbox{if } n\in\ghostlmd\inter\InternalNodes.
%%%%%
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
The above equalities are assumed pointer-preserving, and are well-defined since an external node can only be justified by another external node. We define
the \defname{core} of $s$ as $\core{s} = \coresymbol_\epsilon(s)$,
and the \defname{core P-view} of $s$ as $\pview{\core{s}}$, the P-view of its core.
\end{definition}

In the above definition, the subscript parameter $\overline{y}$ is called \defname{stack of pending lambdas}. As the sequence is read backwards, it accumulates variable names which then get prepended to the last external lambda nodes in the sequence. Hence the \emph{core projection} is the sub-sequence obtained by removing internal nodes and prepending to each external lambda node's label, the stack of \emph{pending lambdas} between that point to the next external node.

Since the core of a justified sequence only contains external nodes it follows that $\coresymbol$ is idempotent.

\begin{example}Take the term $\lambda w . (\lambda x y .x) z$ and consider traversal $t = \lambda w\cdot @ \cdot \lambda x y\cdot x\cdot\lambda \cdot z$.
    Then $\coresymbol(t) = \lambda wy \cdot z$.
\end{example}


\begin{example} Take $(\lambda x. x x)(\lambda y. y)$ with traversal
$t$ represented below. Projecting nodes hereditarily justified by the root gives
$\Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda}\ (n1-n0){{\ghostvar^1}}}$
while the core projection gives
$\coresymbol(t) = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda y}\ (n1-n0){y}}$.
$$t = \Pstr[0.5cm]{
    (n0){\lambda}
    ~(n1){@}
    ~(n2-n1){\lambda x}
    ~(n3-n2){x}
    ~(n4-n1){\lambda y}
    ~(n5-n4){y}
    ~(n6-n3){\lambda }
    ~(n7-n2){x}
    ~(n8-n1){\lambda y}
    ~(n9-n8){y}
    ~(n10-n7,33){\ghostlmd^{1}}
    ~(n11-n6,34){\ghostvar^{1}}
    ~(n12-n5,35){\ghostlmd^{1}}
    ~(n13-n4,37){\ghostvar^{2}}
    ~(n14-n3,38){\ghostlmd^{2}}
    ~(n15-n2,39){\ghostvar^{2}}
    ~(n16-n1,40){\ghostlmd^{2}}
    ~(n17-n0,40){\ghostvar^{1}}
}$$
\end{example}



\subsection{Traversals of the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus}
Traversals for simply-typed languages, such as STLC and PCF, were previously studied in~\cite{BlumPhd}.
A notable limitation is that the tree traversed is built from the \emph{ eta-long form} of the term, a conversion that involves eta-expanding some subterms so as to ensure that every strict subterm that is not of atomic type has necessarily another term applied to it. We omit the formal definition~\cite{huet75-unification, BlumPhd, OngLics2006} which is not essential.
 Effectively, this means that the STLC computation tree is obtained by eta-expanding all variable and application nodes according to the type of the corresponding subterm: if it is $\tau_1 \rightarrow \ldots (\tau_m \rightarrow o)$ and the node has $n< m$ children then the subterm is eta-expanded $m-n$ times.

 In STLC computation trees, the lambda nodes labels consist of typed-annotated variable names, but those annotations are not used in any way by the  traversals rules. We can thus apply the rules of Table~\ref{tab:trav_rules} on a typed-term by just erasing all its types.
With this assumption, the definition of STLC traversal from \cite{BlumPhd} coincides with the following definition. Without loss of generality we can consider a closed term $M^\tau$ of simple type $\tau$. We write $\etalf{M^\tau}$ to denote its \emph{eta-long form}.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:concrete_traversals}
The set $\travset_\concrete$ of \defname{concrete} traversals is defined by the rules of Table~\ref{tab:trav_rules} without \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar} and such that \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{IVar} are restricted to their concrete sub-case, that is the next node traversed must be structural (\ie, $i\leq|m|$).
\end{definition}
Concrete traversals are precisely the imaginary traversals that have no ghost occurrence.

\begin{definition}[STLC traversals]
The set of traversals $\travstlc(M^\tau)$ of a simply-typed term $M^\tau$ is defined
 as $\travset_{\concrete}(\etalf{M^\tau})$.
\end{definition}

Imaginary and STLC traversals still coincide with a slightly relaxed restriction:
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:ulc_and_stlc_trav_coincide}
$\travstlc(M^\tau)$ is obtained by applying on $\etalf{M^\tau}$ the system of rules of Table~\ref{tab:trav_rules} where only \rulenamet{IVar} is restricted to its concrete subcase.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Because the term is eta-long, the condition $i>|m|$ in rule \rulenamet{Var} never holds while traversing the term. This is shown by induction on the rules, observing that the arity of an $@$-node is necessarily equal to the arity of its $0$th child lambda node, and the arity of a variable node with binding index $i$ is necessarily equal to the arity of the $i$th child of its binder's parent.
Since we explicitly exclude the eta-expanded sub-case of \rulenamet{IVar}, the rules match with those of $\travset_\concrete$.
\end{proof}


\section{Evaluation with Traversals}
\label{sec:normalizing_trav}

The idea of using traversals to evaluate lambda terms stems from the \emph{Normalized Paths Characterization} result stating that the set of P-views of traversal cores captures what is strictly required from traversals to reconstruct the normal form of a term when it exists.
This characterization was previously shown for simply-typed term in eta-long form via
a correspondence with Game Semantics,
 and is recalled in Proposition~\ref{prop:path_charact_stlc};
 in Section~\ref{sec:correctness_ulc_normalization} we generalize it to all untyped terms with a normal form using instead a term-rewriting argument (Theorem~\ref{thm:path_charact_ulc}).
This result suggests a normalization method consisting in simply enumerating all the maximal traversals.
The challenge is that there are arbitrarily long traversals due to the generous non-determinism of the rule \rulenamet{IVar} that dictates how to traverse a free variable node.
Even worse: even for terms with a beta-normal form
there may be infinitely many maximal imaginary traversals!
Fortunately, not all of them are needed: a traversal shall be considered redundant if there exist a shorter one with identical core P-view.
In that respect, it is sufficient to consider a subset covering every possible core P-view.

We first consider the subset of \emph{essential traversals} which is complete with respect to core P-views, and finitely enumerable for simply-typed terms in eta-long form.
To address the general case of untyped terms,
where \emph{essential traversals} can be infinite even for normal forms, we introduce a stricter kind of traversals, called \emph{normalizing traversals} that further limits the non-determinism of the \rulenamet{IVar} rule.

\subsection{Essential traversals}

The traversals defined so far may be infinitely long. This is expected for non-normalizing terms such as $\Omega = (\lambda x. x x)(\lambda y. y y)$ which has an infinitely long traversal $\lambda x \cdot x \cdot \lambda y \cdot y \cdot x \cdot \lambda y \cdot y \cdot \ldots$. But this also occurs for terms with a normal form. Take for example $M = \lambda f . f (\lambda x. x)$, then for all $k\geq0$ the justified sequence $t_k = \lambda f \cdot f \cdot (\lambda x \cdot  x)^k$ is a traversal, where every occurrence of $\lambda x$ points to $f$ and every $x$ points to the preceding $\lambda x$.
This is because \rulenamet{IVar} offers two non-deterministic choices when traversing a free variable:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(J)] The justifier variable to pick in the O-view;
\item[(L)] The lambda node to pick amongst the children of the variable node picked in (J).
\end{itemize}
The choice (J) alone gives rise to the pattern displayed in $t_k$ where the node $\lambda x$ from the O-view is repeatedly picked {\it ad infinitum} within a single traversal.

The analogy with Game Semantics explains why traversals can be infinite: In the game denotation of a lambda term $M$, at every point in a play where it is Opponent's turn to play, all possible Opponent moves must be accounted for.
This is to model the behaviour of \emph{all} contexts that can possibly interact with $M$. To continue with the above example, for every $k$ there exists a term that applies its argument $k$ times, for instance $F_k = \lambda g . g (g ( \ldots (g z)))$ with $k$ applications of $g$.
The traversals $t_k$, $k\geq 0$, correspond to plays
 in the game denotation that account for the possibility of
 such terms being applied to $M$. Fortunately, traversals accounting for those contexts are redundant for normalization: due to the absence of side-effects, calling the same argument multiple times always involves the same underlying computation in $M$. We formalize this intuition with the notion of \emph{essential traversals}:

\begin{definition}
\label{dfn:essential_traversals}
The set of \defname{essential traversals} $\travsetes$ is the subset of $\travulc$ defined by induction with the rules of Table~\ref{tab:trav_rules} where the justifier node in the
input-variable rule \rulenamet{IVar} is restricted to be necessarily the last node in the traversal: \ie, $m=n$ and the traversal obtained is $\Pstr[0.5cm]{t \cdot (n){n} \cdot (l-n,25:i){\alpha}} \in \travsetes$.
We will use the subscript `${}_\essential$' to refer to this system of rules.
% The input variable rule can thus be stated by the following derivation rule:
% \infrule[$\rulefont{IVar_\essential}$]
%      {t \cdot n \in\travsetes
%       \andalso n \in\ExternalNodes\inter\NodesVar
%       \andalso n \enables_i\alpha
%       \andalso i \geq 1
%      }
%      {\Pstr[0.5cm]{t \cdot (n){n} \cdot (l-n,25:i){\alpha}} \in \travsetes}

We write $\travsetcones$ to denote the set of
\defname{concrete and essential} traversals ($\travsetes \inter \travsetcon$).
 That is, the traversals obtained by imposing the above restriction on the rules of $\travsetcon$ from Definition~\ref{def:concrete_traversals}.
\end{definition}

As traversals unfolds, a depth-first exploration of the tree of the beta-normal form takes place, where rule \rulenamet{IVar} implements the non-deterministic `branching points'. Since lambda-terms are pure of side-effects,
it is sufficient to explore each possible branch only once.
\emph{Essential traversals} implement this idea by restricting the rule \rulenamet{IVar} so as to traverse only nodes leading to paths in the computation tree that the traversal as so far not explored: when picking the lambda node to visit next, it forces choice `(J)' to be the \emph{latest} variable node in the traversal. Concrete traversals, on the other hand, and restricts choice `(L)' to be a child lambda node of that variable node in the \emph{structural} computation tree.

Continuing with the game-semantics intuition: Lambda nodes correspond to opponent moves, and restricting the opponent moves limit the set of contexts in which a term can appear. The restriction imposed by essential traversals effectively excludes all contexts which apply a term $A$ to $M$ and such that $A$ evaluates any two of its higher-order arguments in a nested fashion. This excludes contexts involving $F_k$, $k\geq 2$, or Kierstead's terms $\lambda f .f (\lambda x .f (\lambda y.y))$ and $\lambda f .f (\lambda x .f (\lambda y.x))$ where $f$ occurs more than once, but also $\lambda f. \lambda g . f (\lambda f .(\lambda x . g (\lambda y . x)))$ where the two arguments $f$ and $g$ occur in a nested expression.

\iflongversion
\begin{property}
\label{prop:core_truncation_at_externallambda}
Let $t\in\travulc$ be a traversal which does not contain any ghost occurrence, and $m$ be an occurrence in $t$ of an external $\lambda$-node (\ie, $m \in \NodesLmd\inter\ExternalNodes$). Then $\core{t_{<m}} = \core{t}_{<m}$.
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
By an easy induction on $t$ using the fact that in the recursive calculation of $\coresymbol(t)$, external lambda nodes reset the stack of pending lambdas.
\end{proof}
\fi

We introduce a quotient relation to identify traversals with identical core P-views:
\begin{definition}[Quotienting]
The core P-view function
$\travulc \longrightarrow \justseqset $
is the composition of
the P-view function
%$\pview{\_}\colon \justseqset \longrightarrow \justseqset$
 with the core projection
 % $\coresymbol\colon\travulc  \longrightarrow \justseqset$
 that is $t \longmapsto \pview{\core{t}}$.
We define $\sim$ as the equivalence relation over $\travulc$ induced by it up to relabelling (same structure but not necessarily the same labels). Formally: $t \sim u$ if and only if $\pview{\core{t}} \equiv \pview{\core{u}}$.
We write $\travulc/{\sim}$ for the set of equivalence classes of $\travulc$.
We identify a $\sim$-equivalence class with the structure of the P-view core of the traversals it contains.
A subset $T\subseteq \travulc$ is \defname{$\sim$-complete} if it contains at least one element for each $\sim$-equivalence class; that is if $T/{\sim} = \travulc/{\sim}$.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:essential_traversal_simcomplete}
  The set of essential traversals $\travsetes$ is  $\sim$-complete.
\end{proposition}
\proofatend
%\begin{proof}
Let $t\in\travulc$ and let's first assume that $t$ does not contain any ghost occurrence. We show by strong induction on $t$ that there is a subsequence $u\in\travsetes$ of $t$ such that $\pview{\core{t}} = \pview{\core{u}}$, and so in particular
$\pview{\core{t}} \equiv \pview{\core{u}}$.
We do a case analysis on the last node $t^\omega$ of $t$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $t^\omega\in \ExternalNodes$: Suppose $t^\omega$ is a variable or an $@$ node then we can conclude immediately from the induction hypothesis on $t_{<t^\omega}$ and using the rules \rulenamet{Lmd} of $\travsetnorm$.

Suppose $t^\omega$ is a lambda node. If it has no justifier then it is the root in which case we conclude by taking  $u=t=t^\omega$. Otherwise let $m$ denote $t^\omega$'s justifier in $t$. By the I.H.~on $t_{\leq m}$ there is $u' \in \travsetnorm$ such that $\core{u'} = \core{t_{\leq m}}$. Take $u = u' \cdot t^\omega$ where $t^\omega$ points to its immediate predecessor $m$. Then $u$ is clearly a $\travsetnorm$-traversal by rule \rulenamet{IVar} and:
\begin{align*}
\pview{\core{u}} &= \pview{\core{u'}} \cdot t^\omega & \mbox{Def.~of $\coresymbol$}\\
 &= \pview{\core{t_{\leq m}} \cdot t^\omega} & \mbox{By I.H.~on $t_{\leq m}$}\\
 &= \pview{\core{t}_{\leq m} \cdot t^\omega} & \parbox[t]{8cm}{By Prop.~\ref{prop:core_truncation_at_externallambda} since $m$ is necessarily followed in $t$ by a $\lambda$-node in $\ExternalNodes$.}
\end{align*}
Now because $m$ justifies $t^\omega$, by Def.~of P-view, \emph{up to renaming of lambda variables} the sequences $\pview{\core{t}_{\leq m} \cdot t^\omega}$ and $\pview{\core{t}}$ are equal: $\pview{\core{t}_{\leq m} \cdot t^\omega} \equiv \pview{\core{t}}$.
 But because $m$ is a variable node, its label is kept untouched by the transformation $\coresymbol$ and therefore the equality holds.

\item $t^\omega\not\in \ExternalNodes$: Let $n$ be the last occurrence in $t$ that is in $\ExternalNodes$, and let $m_1 \ldots m_q$, $q>0$ be the occurrences of internal nodes following $n$ in $t$ (so that $m_q = t^\omega$). By definition of the traversal rules, a variable in $\ExternalNodes$ is necessarily followed by a lambda node in $\ExternalNodes$, therefore $n$ is necessarily a lambda node. By definition of $\coresymbol$, $n$ is therefore also the last occurrence in $\core{t}$ therefore $\core{t} = \core{t}_{\leq n}$.
But \emph{up to relabelling}, $\core{t}_{\leq n} = \core{t_{\leq n}}$; more precisely, $\core{t}_{\leq n}$ is obtained from $\core{t_{\leq n}}$
by pre-pending to $n$'s label the stack of pending lambdas of $t_{>m}$ (the internal nodes following $n$ in $t$). Applying the induction hypothesis on $t_{\leq n}$ gives $\core{t_{\leq n}} = \core{u'}$ for some $u' \in \travsetnorm$.
To conclude it therefore suffices that to show that $u = u' \cdot m_1 \ldots m_q$ is also a traversal of $\travsetnorm$.

We prove by finite induction on $q$ that $u_{\leq m_q} \in\travsetnorm$ and $m_q$'s justifying node and label are same in $u$ and $t$. For $q=0$, we just apply rule \rulenamet{Lam} on $u'$.
For $q>0$: by case analysis on the rule used to visit $m_q$ in $t$.
For structural rules \rulenamet{Root}, \rulenamet{App} and \rulenamet{Lam} it follows immediately by induction.
Rule \rulenamet{Var}: If $m_q \in \NodesVar$ then by the Path-View correspondence, $\pview{u_{<m_q}}$ is a path in the tree from the root to $m_q$ therefore $m_q$'s binder necessarily occur in $u$, we can therefore conclude using the I.H.~on $u_{<m_q}$ and applying \rulenamet{Var} on $u_{<m_q}$ to get $u_{\leq m_q}$.
\end{itemize}
Suppose that $t$ contains ghost occurrences then we consider the term $M^t$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:eta_expanded_trav}(i), $\eta_t(t)$ is a traversal of $M^t$. Hence by the above, there exists $u'\in\travsetnorm(M^t)$ such that
$\pview{\core{u'}}=\pview{\core{\eta_t(t)}}$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:eta_expanded_trav}(ii),
there exists $u \in \travulc(M)$ such that
$u' = \eta_t(u)$.
% TODO: clarify
Recall that the normalizing traversals is defined as the subset of traversals where external lambda nodes always point to their immediate predecessor. Therefore since $\eta_t$ is pointer-preserving $u$ must necessarily belong to $\travsetnorm(M)$.

By definition of $\coresymbol$ we have $\core{t} = \core{\eta_t(t)}$, and since $u$ is a subsequence of $t$ we also have $\core{u} = \core{\eta_t(u)}$.
Hence $\pview{\core{t}}=\pview{\core{\eta_t(t)}}=
\pview{\core{u'}} = \pview{\core{\eta_t(u)}} = \pview{\core{u}}$.
%\end{proof}

\subsection{Normalization procedure for eta-long forms (STLC)}

For typed languages such as the STLC, PCF or Idealized Algol, the theory of traversals~\cite{OngLics2006} concretely relates to Game Semantics: they are in one to one correspondence with the plays of the game denotation in which all internal moves are revealed; and \emph{traversal cores} give the actual plays~\cite{BlumPhd}.
\begin{theorem}[STLC Game Semantics Correspondence -- Theorem 4.96 in~\cite{BlumPhd}]
\label{thm:gamesem_correspondence_stlc}
For any (closed) simply-typed term $M^\tau$,
 $\travstlc(M^\tau)$ is in bijection with the \emph{revealed game denotation} $\revsem{M^\tau}$; and its image by $\coresymbol$--the traversal cores--is in bijection with the innocent game denotation $\sem{M^\tau}$.
\end{theorem}


% Proof idea: ``traversals implement left-most linear reduction''.
% The proof sketch:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Show that `leftmost linear reduction' yields the `quasi normal form'.  (Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_nf}(ii))
% \item Observe that if $M$ is beta-normal then its set of traversal cores P-views is precisely the set of paths in the tree representation of M
% \item If $M$ reduces to $N$ using the leftmost linear reduction then the traversal cores P-views of $N$ are isomorphic to the traversals core P-views of $M$.
% \item Reducing a trivial redex preserves (modulo some traversal prefix) the set of traversals.
% The interesting part of the proof will be to show how the ghost nodes gradually ``materialize'' after each step of the linear reduction, and how the arity threshold gives the right bound for limiting eta-expansion.
% \end{itemize}

Consequently, traversals characterize
the paths in the tree representation of the beta-normal form of a simply-typed term in eta-long form:
\begin{proposition}[Normalized Paths Characterization for STLC]
\label{prop:path_charact_stlc}
Let $M^\tau$ be a closed simply typed term
with eta-long beta-normal form $N^\tau$
we have $\travstlc(M^\tau)/{\sim} = \pathset(N^\tau)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 By soundness of Game Semantics, beta-eta equivalent terms have the same game denotation, therefore by Theorem~\ref{thm:gamesem_correspondence_stlc}, the traversals of the beta-normal form are the traversals cores of the term. The Path-View correspondence (Proposition~\ref{prop:ulctrav_welldefined_pathview}) and Proposition~\ref{prop:ulc_and_stlc_trav_coincide} then show that the P-views of traversal cores of $M^\tau$ give the tree paths of the eta-long form of the beta normal form of $M^\tau$.
\end{proof}

This yields the normalization procedure for the simply-typed lambda calculus from Algorithm~\ref{algo:stlc_normalization_by_traversals}, originally implemented in~\cite{BlumGalop2008, Blum-HogTool}.

\begin{algorithm}[!ht]

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Calculate the eta-long form $\etalf{M^\tau}$ of $M^\tau$ with respect to $T$;

  \end{itemize}
  \item Reconstruct from the paths thus obtained the tree of the eta-long $\beta$-nf of $M^\tau$.

\begin{property}
    \label{prop:concrete_essential_trav_finite}
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item[(i)] Traversals in $\travsetcones$ are finite;
        \item[(ii)] The set $\travsetcones$ is finite.
    \end{enumerate*}
    \end{property}
    \begin{proof}
    (i) It turns out that the rules of \emph{concrete and essential} traversals are precisely the ones used in \cite{OngLics2006} for recursion schemes (no free variables and term of ground type), where \rulenamet{IVar} is replaced by \rulenamet{Sig}. We can therefore appeal to the Spinal Decomposition
    \cite[Lemma 8]{OngLics2006} which shows that if $t$ is infinite then there is an infinite sequence of prefixes of $t$ whose P-views (the \emph{spine} of $t$) is strictly increasing. By the P-view--Path correspondence there must be an infinite path in the structural computation tree which gives a contradiction. Hence $t$ is either finite or contains a ghost node.
    (ii) Rules that do not involve ghost nodes all have bounded non-determinism therefore a concrete traversal only has a finite number of immediate extensions. Since the traversals are finite, this implies that the set of traversals is itself finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Correctness of STLC normalization]
Algorithm~\ref{algo:stlc_normalization_by_traversals} terminates and returns the eta-long beta-normal form of the input term.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\emph{Soundness} A beta-normal term is uniquely determined by the set of maximal paths in its tree representation (Property~\ref{prop:tree_path_charact}). By Proposition~\ref{prop:path_charact_stlc}, this set corresponds precisely to the set of core P-views of \emph{concrete} traversals,
and by Proposition~\ref{prop:essential_traversal_simcomplete} its is also given by the core P-views of \emph{essential} concrete traversals.
\emph{Termination} By Property~\ref{prop:concrete_essential_trav_finite} the set of concrete essential traversals is finite and each traversal is itself finite, therefore the enumeration in Algorithm~\ref{algo:stlc_normalization_by_traversals} terminates.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Normalizing traversals}

For simply-typed terms in eta-long forms, the
Normalized Paths Characterization theorem holds for concrete traversals so we could  handle the infiniteness of traversals by restricting the enumeration to \emph{structural} ones. For untyped terms, however, concrete traversals
are so restrictive (they eliminate all the ghost nodes!) that they prevent any such characterization.
A more relaxed restriction is needed.
We recall that, just like imaginary traversals, the set of essential traversals is infinite because in the \emph{on-the-fly eta-expansion} of rule $\rulename{IVar}$ the justification label $i>0$ is unbounded. In this section, we show that,
for the purpose of term evaluation, $i$ can be bounded by a quantity called the \emph{arity threshold} computable from the traversal,
effectively limiting the number of times eta-expansion can be performed by rule \rulenamet{IVar} for the sake of discovering the set of paths of the beta-normal form. In section \ref{sec:correctness_ulc_normalization} we show that this suffice to  sufficient to characterize the normal form of a lambda term when it exists.

The imaginary traversal rules allows for infinitely many eta-expansions, which may provide some satisfaction from the semantics standpoint: each eta-expansion represents how the term will interact with its arguments if more arguments were to be applied to it. In the spirit of finding a normal form, however, eta-expanding subterms ad-infinitum is pointless: traversing ghost nodes only helps if it eventually leads to some structural node of the final normal term tree that we set out to evaluate.

Because the tree has a finite number of nodes, the nodes arities are bounded by some maximal value. Which means that beyond a certain value, the
justification pointer $i$ in the variable rules \rulenamet{IVar} is guaranteed to be greater than the arity $|m|$ of the variable, and therefore the next node to visit is necessarily a ghost node. The intuition behind the arity threshold is that after a sufficiently large number of eta-expansions, we are also guaranteed to \emph{continuously} traverse ghost nodes that never materialize to structural nodes. In other words, any further extension will necessarily be constructed using repeated applications of \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar} and the eta-expanded variants of \rulenamet{Var}, and will thus consists only of ghost occurrences.


\begin{definition}
\label{ref:strand}
A \defname{strand} of a traversal $t$, is a sub-sequence of consecutive nodes of even length from $t$, starting with an external lambda node and ending with an external variable node, with only internal node occurrences in-between.
\end{definition}

From the parity property of traversals, a strand must consist of alternations of lambda nodes and variable/application nodes. We will highlight a strand within a traversal by underlining its first and last occurrence as follows:
$$ t = \cdots \underline{\alpha_k}\ n_k\ \alpha_{k-1}\ n_{k-1}\ \cdots\ \alpha_2\ n_2\ \alpha_1\ \underline{n_1} \cdots $$
for some $k\geq 1$ where for $1 \leq j \leq k$, $\alpha_j$ is in $\ExtendedNodesLmd$, $n_j$ is in $\ExtendedNodesVar\union\NodesApp$, and the $2k-2$ nodes occurring between $\alpha_k$ and $n_1$ are internal nodes.

\begin{definition} %[Traversal arity threshold]
\label{dfn:arity-threshold}
The \defname{arity threshold} of a traversal $t$ ending with a strand
 of length $2k$ for $k>0$ of the shape $\underline{\alpha_k}\,n_k\,\alpha_{k-1}\,n_{k-1}\cdots \alpha_2\,n_2\, \alpha_1\,\underline{n_1}$ where $\alpha_j \in \ExtendedNodesLmd$, $n_j \in \ExtendedNodesVar\union\NodesApp$ for all $1\leq j\leq k$ is
$$
\arth(t)
  = \max_{q=1..k} \left( |n_q| + \sum_{j=1..q-1} (|n_j|-|\alpha_j|) \right) \ .
$$
% \begin{align*}
%     \arth(t) &= \max_{q=1..k} \left( |n_q| + \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j \right)     = \max_{q=1..k} \left( |\alpha_q| + \sum_{j=1..q} \delta_j\right)
% \end{align*}
\end{definition}

We introduce the abbreviations $\delta_j = |n_j|-|\alpha_j|$
and $\Delta_q = \sum_{j=1..q} \delta_j$ so that
$\arth(t)
   = \max_{q=1..k} \left( |n_q| + \Delta_{q-1} \right)
   = \max_{q=1..k} \left( |\alpha_q| + \Delta_{q} \right)
$.
% = |n_1|-|\alpha_1| + |n_2|-|\alpha_2| + \cdots + |n_{q-1}|-|\alpha_{q-1}| + |n_q|$
Or equivalently, it is the maximal value in the sequence $b_1 = |n_1|$, $b_{q+1} = b_q + |n_{q+1}|-|\alpha_q|$ for $1 \leq q \leq k-1$.
We can thus calculate it by reading the strand backwards from the last variable occurrence and alternatively adding and subtracting the node arities until reaching an external variable. The maximal value observed throughout that summation is the arity threshold.


The rule $\rulename{IVar_\essential}$ leaves infinitely many choices of value for the link label. The following property shows that if that value exceeds the arity threshold then only ghost nodes can be traversed from that point on, without ever materializing a structural node.
\begin{proposition}[Weaving]
\label{prop:weaving}
Let $t$ be an essential traversal of $\travsetes$ ending with a strand of the form
$\underline{\alpha_k}\,n_k\,\alpha_{k-1}\, n_{k-1}\cdots\alpha_2\,n_2\, \alpha_1\,\underline{n_1}$ for some $k\geq1$, and $t_{\max}$ be a maximal essential extension of $t$. By rule $\rulename{IVar_\essential}$, $t$ is immediately followed in $t_{\max}$ by an external $\lambda$-node justified by $t^\omega$ with label $i\geq 1$.

%We defined the sequence of labels $(i_j)_{j\geq1}$ as follows:
%$$ i_{q+1} = i_1 + \sum_{j=1..q} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|) $$

We consider the following sequence of indices for $0\leq q\leq k$:
$$i_{q+1} = i + \sum_{j=1..q} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|) = i - \sum_{j=1..q} \delta_j.
= i - \Delta_q
$$
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item If $i>\arth(t)$ then $t$ is followed in $t_{\max}$ by a strand of length $2k$ consisting of ghost nodes only with justification labels
$i_1$, $i_2$, $i_2$, $i_3$, $i_3$, $\cdots$, $i_{k}$, $i_{k}$, $i_{k+1}$:
$$

and since $\lambda\overline{x}$ is structural, we have $i_{r+1} \leq |n_{r+1}|$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\shortproof
(i) By finite induction on $q\in\{1..k\}$. Base case $q=1$ is taken care of by rule \rulenamet{IVar_\essential} followed by
\rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar_\essential}.
For $1<q\leq k$, the induction hypothesis shows that $t_{max}$ has the desired until the pair $\ghostlmd \cdot \ghostvar$ respectively justified by
$n_{q-1}$ with label $i_{q-1}$, and $\alpha_{q-1}$ with labels $i_q$.

The induction hypothesis gives
$i_{q} = i - \Delta_{q-1} = i + |n_q| - (|n_q| + \Delta_{q-1} )$, which is greater or equal than $i + |n_q| - \max_{r=1..k} ( |n_r| + \Delta_{r-1})
= i + |n_q| - \arth(t) $.
Since by assumption $i>\arth(t)$ this implies that $i_{q} > |n_q|$.
We can therefore use rule \rulenamet{Var_\essential}
to traverse a ghost lambda justified by  $n_{q}$ and labelled by $i_q$
(since by the strand definition, $\alpha_{q-1}$ is an internal node).
We then use rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar_\essential} to traverse the next ghost variable justified by $\alpha_q$ and labelled by $i_{q+1} = i_q + |\alpha_{q}| -|n_{q}|$.

(ii) By repeatedly applying (i), observing that since ghost nodes have arity $0$, the arity threshold at $t$ must be $0$. Hence, any link label $j>0$ chosen to extend the traversal at that point will be strictly greater than the arity threshold.

(iii) By assumption we have
$i \leq \arth(t) = \max_{q=1..k} \left( |n_q| + \Delta_{q-1} \right)
$
and since $k\geq 1$, the set $\{1..k\}$ is not empty so there is at least one $q$ such that $i - \Delta_{q-1} \leq |n_q|$, or equivalently, $i_q \leq |n_q|$ by definition of $i_{q}$. We conclude by taking $r+1$ to be the smallest such $q$, and applying the same argument as (i) for all $q<r$.
\endshortproof
\proofatend
%\begin{proof}
(i) By the alternation property of traversals, the last strand of $t$ consists of a succession of lambda nodes $\alpha_q$ and variable or $@$-nodes $n_q$, with indices in $\{1..k\}$.

We show by finite induction on $q\in\{1..k\}$ that the first $2k$ nodes after $t^\omega$ are successive pairs of ghost lambda and ghost variable nodes justified in order by $n_1, \alpha_1, n_2, \alpha_2, n_3, \ldots, n_k, \alpha_k$ with respective labels $i_1, i_2, i_2, i_3, i_3, \ldots, i_k, i_k, i_{k+1}$ defined by:
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    i_1 &= i \\
    i_{q+1} &= i_q + |\alpha_q| - |n_q| \hbox{, $1\leq q \leq k$}.
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Base case $q=1$: Because $t^\omega$ is a ghost external variable node, the only rule to apply is \rulenamet{IVar_\essential}, and by assumption the following node is a ghost lambda node justified by $t^\omega$ with label $i_1 = i$. By rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar_\essential} the next node is a ghost variable justified by $\alpha$ with label $i_2 = i + |\alpha_1| - |t^\omega|$.

$$ t_{\max} = \Pstr[0.3cm]{ \cdots (alpha){\alpha_1}\ (m){t^\omega}\ (l-m,30:i){\ghostlmd}\ (t-alpha,45:i_2){\ghostvar} \cdots} $$

\item Let $1<q\leq k$, applying the induction hypothesis on $q$ gives:
$$
t_{\max} = \Pstr[0.3cm]{
   \cdots
  (aq){\alpha_q}\
  (nq){n_q} \
  (aqm1){\alpha_{q-1}}\
  (nqm1){n_{q-1}}
 \cdots
 t^\omega\ \cdots
  (lk-nqm1,35:{i_{q-1}})\ghostlmd\
  (tq-aqm1,40:{i_{q}})\ghostvar\
   \cdots
}
$$

We then have $i_{q} > |n_q|$ since:
\begin{align*}
i_{q} &= i - \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j
&\qquad\hbox{(by induction hypothesis)}\\
    &> \arth(t) - \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j
&\qquad\hbox{(assumption $i> \arth(t)$)} \\
        &= \max_{r=1..k} \left( |n_r| + \sum_{j=1..r-1} \delta_j \right)
        - \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j
& \qquad\hbox{(definition of $\arth$)} \\
    &\geq |n_q| + \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j - \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j
&\qquad\hbox{(take $r=q$)} \\
    &= |n_q|
\end{align*}


By definition of the strand, $\alpha_{q-1}$ is hereditarily justified by an $@$ node.
Since $i_q > |n_q|$, by rule \rulenamet{Var_\essential} the next node is necessarily a ghost lambda node justified by $n_q$ with label $i_q$. With rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostvar_\essential} the following node is a ghost variable node $\ghostvar$ justified by $\alpha_q$ and labelled by $i_{q+1} = i_q + |\alpha_{q}| -|n_{q}|$.
\end{itemize}

(ii) By (i) the next strand following $t$ consists solely of ghost nodes and ends with a ghost variable $\ghostvar$ hereditarily justified by the root. Since ghost nodes have arity $0$, the arity threshold at that point is $0$. Hence, any label value $j$ chosen to extend the traversal at that point will be strictly greater than the arity threshold: thus by (i) the next strand consists solely of ghost nodes.
Applying the argument repeatedly shows that all the occurrences following $t$ are necessarily ghost nodes.

(iii) By definition of $\arth(t)$ we have
$i \leq \arth(t) = \max_{q=1..k} \left( |n_q| + \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j \right)
$
and since $k\geq 1$, the set $\{1..k\}$ is not empty so there is at least one $q$ such that $i - \sum_{j=1..q-1} \delta_j \leq |n_q|$, or equivalently, $i_q \leq |n_q|$ by definition of $i_{q}$. We conclude by taking $r+1$ to be the smallest such $q$, and applying the same argument as (i) for all $q<r$.
\endproofatend

This weaving property shows that exceeding the arity threshold when
traversing an external variable, causes expansion of external ghost variable nodes into deeper ghost variable nodes which ultimately leads to traversals that are not relevant for normalization.
This observation suggests a stricter version of traversals:
\begin{definition}[Normalizing traversals]
\label{def:normalizing_traversals}
The set $\travsetnorm$ of \defname{normalizing traversals}, is the subset of essential traversals defined by the rules of Definition~\ref{dfn:essential_traversals} where the index $i$ in rule \rulenamet{IVar} is bounded by the arity threshold of the traversal.
% \infrule[$\rulefont{IVar_\normalizing}$]
%      { t \cdot n \in\travsetnorm
%      \andalso n \in\ExternalNodes\inter\ExtendedNodesVar
%      \andalso n \enables_i \alpha
%      \andalso 1 \leq i \leq\arth(t)}
%      {\Pstr[0.5cm]{t \cdot (n){n} \cdot (l-n,25:i){\alpha}}\in\travsetnorm}
% where $\alpha = \ghostlmd$ just if $i>|n|$.
Table~\ref{tab:normalizing_trav_rules} recapitulates the rules thus obtained  using judgement derivations, where the judgement `$\istraversal t$' means that $t\in\travsetnorm$.
A traversal that cannot be extended is said to be \defname{maximal}.
\end{definition}

%%%%%% remark 1: materialization
Observe that only the variable rule can materialize a structural node from a traversal ending with a ghost node. Thus once a traversal starts to visit ghost nodes, the only way for it to `return'  to structural nodes is via a ghost variable using an instantiation of \rulenamet{Var_\normalizing} of the following form:
$$\rulename{Var_\normalizing}\ \  \Pstr[0.5cm]{ t  \cdot
(y){y} \cdot (l){\alpha}  \ldots (t-l,30:i){\ghostvar}
    \cdot (lx-y,40:i){\lambda \overline{x}}
        \in\travulc}$$
where
 $\lambda \overline{x} \in \NodesLmd$ is the $i$th child lambda node of variable node $y \in \NodesVar$,
$\alpha$ is either a structural or ghost lambda node, and
 $0\leq |\alpha| < i \leq |y|$.
%%%%%%%%

%%%% remark 2: ~-completeness
Observe also that $\travsetnorm$ is \emph{not} $\sim$-complete. The imaginary traversal
$t = \Pstr[0.5cm]{(l){\lambda x} \cdot (x-l){x} \cdot (gl-x){\ghostlmd} \cdot (gv-l){\ghostvar} }$ of  $\lambda x . x$,
for instance, which verifies $\pview{\core{t}} = t$, is not equivalent to $\pview{\core{u}}$ for any $u$ in $\travsetnorm = \{ \epsilon, \lambda x, \lambda x \cdot x \}$.

\section{Examples of Normalization by Traversals}
\label{sec:examples}
Let us walk through the ULC evaluation algorithm~\ref{algo:ulc_normalization_by_traversals} and traversal enumeration of Table~\ref{tab:normalizing_trav_rules} on examples of lambda terms. We write $t_\epsilon$  for the initial traversal up to the first non-deterministic choice; and for every $s \in \nat^*$, we write $t_{s \cdot k}$ for the maximal traversal obtained after extending $t_s$ using a single application of the eta-expanded subcase of rule \rulenamet{IVar} with link-label $k \in \nat$. So that the subscript $s$ in $t_s$ records the non-deterministic choices made so far with rule \rulenamet{IVar}.


\begin{example}[Baby example]
    \label{examp:baby}
  Take the term $(\lambda x. x x) (\lambda y. y)$. Repeatedly applying the structural traversal rules until reaching a non-deterministic choice yields traversal

  $t_\epsilon = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda}\,(n1){@}\,(n2-n1,20){\lambda x}\,(n3-n2,20){x}\,(n4-n1,20){\lambda y}\,(n5-n4,20){y}\,(n6-n3,20){\lambda}\,(n7-n2,20){x}\,(n8-n1,20){\lambda y}\,(n9-n8,20){y}\,(n10-n7,20){\ghostlmd^1}\,(n11-n6,20){\ghostvar^1}\,(n12-n5,20){\ghostlmd^{1}}\,(n13-n4,20){\ghostvar^2}\,(n14-n3,20){\ghostlmd^2}\,(n15-n2,20){\ghostvar^2}\,(n16-n1,20){\ghostlmd^2}\,(n17-n0,20){\ghostvar^1}}$. The last node is justified by the root thus it is an external variable. With \emph{imaginary} traversals,
  rule $\rulename{IVar}$ would let us extend $t_\epsilon$. But here the arity threshold is $\arth(t) = 0$, therefore there is no more \emph{normalizing} traversal to explore: $t_\epsilon$ is maximal. The P-view core is $\pview{\core{t_\epsilon}} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n17-n0){\ghostvar^1}}$ thus the beta-normal form of term is $\lambda y . y$ for some new variable name $y$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Church increment]
\label{examp:churchincrement}
Let $k\geq0$ refer to the Church numerals $\lambda s z . s^k z$
and consider a term $M$ implementing the increment function so that $M k$ reduces to $k+1$ for all $k$. Such a term can be defined as $M \alphaequiv {\sf add}\ 1$ where ${\sf add} \alphaequiv \lambda x y s z. x\, s (y\, s\, z)$. Figure~\ref{fig:comptree_examples} represents the computation tree of $M$. Let us go through the enumeration of its traversals.

Starting at the root and traversing the tree until hitting the first non-deterministic choice produces
$t_\epsilon = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\underline\lambda }\,(n1){@}\,(n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}\,(n3-n2){x}\,(n4-n1,32){\lambda s z}\,(n5-n4,30){s}\,(n6-n3,33){\lambda }\,(n7-n2,37){s}\,(n8-n1,32){\ghostlmd^3}\,(n9-n0,32){\underline{\ghostvar}^2} }$. Throughout this example we underline external nodes to highlight node occurrences at the boundaries of strands.
Its core projection is
$\core{t_\epsilon} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda} \cdot (n9-n0){{\ghostvar^2}} }$
and therefore $\pview{\core{t_\epsilon}} = \lambda\cdot \ghostvar^2$ is a path in the normal form of $M$.
The normal form must therefore have the shape $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s N_1 \ldots N_q$ for some fresh variable $y$ and $s$ and $q\geq0$.

%\item
To determine the $N_k$ arguments from the normal form, we enumerate all the possible instantiation of rule $\rulename{IVar}$ for all non-deterministic choices of value $k\geq 1$, and then recursively extend each traversal until the next non-deterministic choice. But how many values of $k$ shall we consider? Intuitively, we should not eta-expand the node beyond the point where further traversals are guaranteed to visit ghost occurrences only. That upper-bound for $k$ is precisely given by the \emph{arity threshold} of $t_\epsilon$.
We lookup the node arities from the computation tree represented in Figure~\ref{fig:comptree_examples}. The arities of the traversal strand are
 $0,1,4,2,2,1,0,0,0,0$ so the arity threshold is given by the maximum of the intermediate values generated from the summation $(((((0) + -0+0) -0 +1) -2 + 2) -4 +1)$, hence $\arth(t_\epsilon) = \max \{ 0,0,1,1,-2 \} = 1$.
 We thus do not have to consider the cases $k>1$ which means that the normal form has in fact the shape $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s N_1$.

Extending traversal $t_\epsilon$ with rule $\rulename{IVar}$ for $k=1$ gives traversal

$t_1 = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\underline\lambda }
\,(n1){@}
\,(n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}
\,(n3-n2){x}
\,(n4-n1){\lambda s z}
\,(n5-n4){s}
\,(n6-n3){\lambda }
\,(n7-n2){s}
\,(n8-n1){\ghostlmd^3}
\,(n9-n0){\underline{\ghostvar^2}}
(n10-n9){\underline{\ghostlmd^1}}
(n11-n8){\ghostvar^1}
(n12-n7){\ghostlmd^1}
(n13-n6){\ghostvar^1}
(n14-n5){\lambda^1}
(n15-n4)z
(n16-n3){\lambda^2}
(n17-n2)y
(n18-n1){\ghostlmd^2}
(n19-n0){\underline\ghostvar^1}
}$
whose core P-view is given by
$\pview{\core{t_1}} = \lambda \cdot \ghostvar^2 \cdot\ghostlmd^1
\cdot \ghostvar^1$
therefore the normal form is of the shape $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s (y R_1 \ldots R_{q_2})$ for some terms $R_1$, \ldots $R_{q_2}$, and $q_2\geq 0$.

The arity threshold of $t_1$ is $\arth(t_1) = \max \{ 0, 2,2,2,2,0 \} = 2$
(where the $2$ comes from the arity of variable node $y$) hence the normal form is of the shape $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s (y R_1 R_2)$.
We thus apply rule \rulenamet{IVar} for child index $k_2$ ranging from $1$ to $ 2$. For the case $k_2 = 1$:

$t_{11} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\underline\lambda }

(n22-n17,50:1)\lambda % points to non-ghost node
(n23-n2,45:3) s
(n24-n1,44:3) {\ghostlmd^3}
(n25-n0,45:2) {\underline{\ghostvar^2}}
}$

We have $\pview{\core{t_{11}}} =
\Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\lambda}
(n9-n0){\ghostvar^2}
(n10-n9){\ghostlmd^1}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
(n20-n19){\ghostlmd^1}
(n25-n0,40:2){\ghostvar^2}
}$ therefore $\betanf{M}$ is of the form $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s\ (y\ s\ R_2)$.

%\item
Now with $k_2 = 2$, \rulenamet{IVar} extends $t_1$ to:

$t_{12} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\underline\lambda}
\,(n1){@}
\,(n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}
\,(n3-n2){x}

(n16-n3){\lambda^2}
(n17-n2)y
(n18-n1,42){\ghostlmd^2}
(n19-n0,42){\underline{\ghostvar^1}}
(n20-n19){\underline{\ghostlmd^2}} %%%%%%%%
(n21-n18){\ghostvar^2}
(n22-n17,50:2)\lambda % points to non-ghost node
(n23-n2,45:4) z
(n24-n1,44:4) {\ghostlmd^4}
(n25-n0,45:3) {\underline{\ghostvar^3}}
}$

We have $\pview{\core{t_{12}}} =
\Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\lambda }\
 (n9-n0){{\ghostvar^2}}
 (n10-n9){\ghostlmd^1}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
(n20-n19){\ghostlmd^2}
(n25-n0,45:3) {\ghostvar^3}
}$, thus assembling the two maximal tree paths together yields $M$'s beta normal form $\lambda y s z . s(y\, s\, z)$.

This example illustrates how on-the-fly eta-expansion helps resolve the ``missing argument'' problem faced when using the concrete traversal rules of STLC. Take $M = (\lambda u . u\ (y_1\ u)) (\lambda v . v\ y_2)$ whose computation tree  and two maximal normalizing traversals are:

\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(root.north),level distance=3ex,inner ysep=0.5mm,sibling distance=10mm]

                          }
                      }
                  }

                    child{ node {$y_2$}}
                }
            }
        }
    };
\node (t1) at (7cm,-3ex) {
        $t_1 = \Pstr[4ex]{(n0){\lambda }\,(n1){@}\,(n2-n1){\lambda u}\,(n3-n2){u}\,(n4-n1){\lambda v}\,(n5-n4){v}\,(n6-n3){\lambda }\,(n7-n0,35){y_1}\,(n8-n7){\lambda }\,(n9-n2){u}\,(n10-n1){\lambda v}\,(n11-n10){v}\,(n12-n9){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\,(n13-n8){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\,(n14-n13){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\,(n15-n12){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\,(n16-n11){\lambda }\,(n17-n0,35){y_2}\,}$
};
\node (t2) at (7cm,-15ex) {
    $t_2 = \Pstr[4ex]{(n0){\lambda }
    \,(n1){@}
    \,(n2-n1){\lambda u}
    \,(n3-n2){u}
    \,(n4-n1){\lambda v}
    \,(n5-n4){v}
    \,(n6-n3){\lambda }
    \,(n7-n0,35){y_1}
    \,(n8-n7){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}
    \,(n9-n6,30){{\ghostvar^{1}}}
    \,(n10-n5,36){\lambda }
    \,(n11-n0,33){y_2}}$
};
\end{tikzpicture}

Traversing $M$ with concrete rules lets you follow $t_1$ until the second occurrence of $v$ in $t_1$, where the traversal gets stuck due to the bottom node $u$ lacking an operand. Whereas the imaginary traversal instantiates that missing operand on-the-fly, via the ghost child lambda node $\ghostlmd^1$ of $u$.

Traversal $t_2$ illustrates a different situation where, instead of being stuck, the concrete traversals misses a valid path from the beta normal form: variable $y_1$ does have one argument in $M$, which gets traversed by concrete traversals. But the ULC traversal $t_2$ pushes the exploration further by traversing the imaginary second argument to $y_1$, represented by $\ghostlmd^2$, eventually materializing node $y_2$, which ends up being the second argument of $y_1$ in the normal form.

The core P-views
$\pview{\core{t_1}} = \lambda \ y_1\ \lambda \ \ghostvar^{1}
\ \ghostlmd^{1}\ y2$ and  $\pview{\core{t_2}} = \lambda\ y_1\ \ghostlmd^{2}\ y_2$ are the two maximal paths in the beta-normal form.
%%%% With pointers:
%$\pview{\core{t_1}} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){y_1}\ (n2-n1){\lambda }\ (n3-n2){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n4-n3){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n5-n0){y2}\ }$ and  $\pview{\core{t_2}} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){y_1}\ (n2-n1){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}\ (n3-n0){y_2}\ }$
%%%%%%
The beta-normal form of $M$ is thus $y_1 (\lambda  z.z\ y_2) y_2$.

    It's a well-known fact that $\Omega$ does not have a normal form. The term has a unique (infinite) traversal represented below, which starts with

    $$
    }

    Consider each section of the traversal starting with $y_1$ and ending with $y_2$ with no other variable occurrence in-between, and define its length as the number of ghost nodes in-between. Then the lengths of successive such traversal sections have the following pattern: $2,6,14,30,62\ldots$
    One can show that the length of the $i$th section is precisely given by $2\times(2^i-1)$, for $i\geq1$.
    So as the term is being evaluated, it takes exponentially longer to determine that $y_2$ is the argument of $y_1$.
    The resulting infinite traversal is expressed as follows (omitting justification pointers):
    \begin{equation*}
    t_\Omega = \lambda \cdot @ \cdot \lambda x \cdot  x_1 \cdot \lambda y \cdot y_1
    \cdot  \sum_{i\geq 1}
        \left[
            \lambda \cdot x_2 \cdot \lambda y \cdot y_1 \cdot
             {(\ghostlmd\ \ghostvar)}^{2^i -1}\cdot \lambda \cdot y_2
                 \sum_{i\leq j<i}
                    \left(
                        {(\ghostlmd\ \ghostvar)}^{2^j -1}
                        \cdot
                        \lambda \cdot y_2
                    \right)
        \right]
    \end{equation*}
    where $\sum$ represents sequence concatenation and $u^i$ represents the concatenation of $i$ copies of $u$ for $i\geq 0$.
    Represented more succinctly by keeping only variable nodes and omitting redundant lambda and @-nodes:
    $t_\Omega \filter \NodesVar =  x_1 \cdot y_1
        \cdot  \sum_{i\geq 1}
            \left[
                x_2 \cdot y_1 \cdot
                 \ghostvar^{2^i -1}\cdot y_2
                     \sum_{1\leq j <i} (\ghostvar^{2^j -1} \cdot y_2)
            \right]
    $.
    Without ghost nodes, $\Omega$'s traversal semantics can thus be summarized as
    $
        t_\Omega \filter (\NodesVar\inter\ExternalNodes) =  x_1 \cdot y_1
        \cdot  \sum_{i\geq 1} x_2 \cdot y_1 \cdot {y_2}^i \ .
    $

Take $varity\ two$ where
$two \alphaequiv \lambda s_2 z_2 . s_2 (s_2\ z_2)$ and

%To compute the set of normalizing traversals, we apply the traversal rules inductively until an input variable is reached, at which point we eta-expand with rule \rulenamet{IVar} for all possible values of $k$ ranging from $1$ to the arity threshold of the traversal.
The initial traversal $t_\epsilon$ up to the first non-deterministic choice is:

\section{Leftmost linear reduction}
\label{sec:leftmostlinearred}

% lambda calculus basic definitions moved to section
% \ref{sec:lambdacalculus_basics}

\subsection{Head-linear reduction}

In the lambda calculus, a redex is necessarily formed by the outermost lambda in operator position of an application: if the operator consists of consecutive lambda abstractions (\eg, as in $(\lambda x \lambda y . M) A_1 A_2$) then the outermost lambda (\eg, $\lambda x$) is the one that will form the redex. The notion of redex can be generalized to allow evaluation of arguments in any order. In particular, one can allow any of the consecutive $\lambda$-abstractions to form a redex (\eg, the abstraction $\lambda y$ and corresponding argument $A_2$ would be a valid redex). This is formalized by the notion of \emph{generalized redex}--a generalization of the notion of \emph{prime redex} from Danos and Regnier~\cite{danos-head,REGNIER1994281}.
\begin{definition}[Generalized redex]
\label{dfn:generalized_redex}
The set of generalized redexes of a term $M$, written $gr(M)$, is a set of pairs $(\lambda x, A)$ where $\lambda x$ is some abstraction in $M$ and $A$ is a subterm called the argument of $\lambda x$. The head $\lambda$ list of $M$, written $\lambda_l(M)$ is a list of lambda abstractions of $M$. They are defined by induction:
\begin{align*}
gr(v) &= \emptyset & \lambda_l(v) &= \epsilon\\
gr(\lambda x. U) &= gr(U) & \lambda_l(\lambda x. U) &= \lambda x \cdot \lambda_l(U) \\
gr(U V) &= \{ (\lambda x, V) \} \union gr(U) \union gr(V) &
\lambda_l(U V) &= l & \mbox{if $\lambda_l(U) = \lambda x \cdot l$} \\
gr(U V) &= gr(U) \union gr(V) & \lambda_l(U V) &= \epsilon & \mbox{if $\lambda_l(U) = \epsilon$.}
\end{align*}
where $v$ ranges over variable occurrences, $x$ ranges over variable names, $U, V$ range over subterms of $M$, and $\epsilon$ denotes the empty list.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} For any term $M, N, A_1, A_2$ we have
$gr((\lambda x \lambda y . M) A_1 A_2) = \{ (\lambda x, A_1), (\lambda y, A_2)\}$ and
 $gr((\lambda z . (\lambda x \lambda y . M) N) A_1 A_2) = \{ (\lambda z, A_1), (\lambda x, N), (\lambda y, A_2)\}$.
\end{example}

To define head-linear reduction, one needs to consider specific \emph{occurrences} of variables and sub-terms in a given term. In particular, let's emphasize that a generalized redex  $(\lambda x, A)$ refers to specific \emph{occurrence} of $\lambda x$ and subterm $A$.

We say that a variable occurrence is \defname{involved} in the generalized redex $(\lambda x, A)$ if the variable occurrence is bound by $\lambda x$. A variable occurrence can therefore be involved in at most one generalized redex. We define the \defname{linear substitution} of $x$ for $A$ as the term obtained by performing capture-avoiding substitution of that single occurrence of $x$ by $A$. (Compare this to the standard substitution that applies to \emph{every} occurrence of $x$ in $M$.) When performing such substitution we say that we \defname{linearly fire} the generalized redex $(\lambda x, A)$ for that occurrence of $x$.

The \defname{head variable occurrence} (abbreviated \emph{hoc}) of a term is the left-most variable occurring in the term (\ie, the first variable found by depth-first traversal of the term tree.) If the head variable occurrence of a term is involved in a generalized redex then we call that redex the \defname{head-linear redex}.
A term that does not have a head-linear redex is said to be in \defname{quasi head-normal form}.
The \defname{head-linear reduction} $\hlred$ is defined as the reduction that linearly fires the head linear redex, if it exists. It can be shown that the reflexive transitive closure $\rightarrow^*_{hl}$ yields the quasi head-normal form~\cite{danos-head,danosherbelinregnier1996}.

\paragraph{Soundness}
The set of \defname{spine subterms} is defined by induction: a term is a spine subterm of itself; the spine subterms of $U V$ and $\lambda x. U$ are those of $U$.
A \defname{prime redex} ({\it \`a la} Danos-Regnier) is a generalized redex $(\lambda x, A)$ such that the operator of the redex ($\lambda x . U$ for some $U$) is a spine subterm. Danos-Regnier showed the following result (Theorem~2 in~\cite{danos-head}):
\begin{theorem}[Soundness and completeness of head-linear reduction~\cite{danos-head}] \
\label{thm:danosregnier_headlinred}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item If $T \rightarrow^*_{hl} T$  then $T$ and $T'$ are $\beta$-equivalent.
\item If $T$ is in quasi-head normal form and has $n$ prime redexes then the head reduction of $T$ leads to a head normal form in exactly $n$ steps.
\item If $T$ is any term, the head linear reduction of $T$ terminates iff the head reduction of $T$ terminates.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Leftmost linear reduction}

As the name indicates, the head-linear reduction is a linear version of the \emph{head} reduction. It thus only yields the quasi \emph{head}-normal form, not the normal form, and therefore is not complete for normalization.

In the standard lambda calculus, normal-order reduction strategy is obtained by repeatedly applying head reduction to get to the head-normal form, and then continuously applying the head-reduction on each argument of the head variable.
This ultimately yields the normal form of the term if it exists.
We now define the linear counterpart of the normal-order reduction: Informally, the \defname{leftmost linear reduction strategy} is the strategy that performs head-linear reduction if possible, and otherwise, if the term is in quasi-head normal form, continuously (and recursively) applies the head-linear reduction on each argument (from left to right) of the head variable occurrence.
Formally:

\begin{definition}[Leftmost linear reduction]
    \label{def:leftmostlinearreduction}
Given a term $M$, we write $\VarOcc(M)$ for the set of variable occurrences in $M$
and $\VarOcc^\bot(M)$ for $\{\bot \} + \VarOcc(M)$ where the bottom element $\bot$ represents the `undefined' occurrence. We introduce the partial order $\sqsubseteq$ on $\VarOcc^\bot(M)$ defined by: for all $x,y \in \VarOcc^\bot(M)$, $x \sqsubseteq y$ if and only if $x = y$ or $x = \bot$. We define the partial function $lloc_M$ from subterms of $M$ to variable occurrences by induction on the subterms of $M$:
\begin{align*}
lloc_M(v) &=
    \begin{cases}
    v &\mbox{if $v$ is involved in a generalized redex in $M$,} \\
    \bot & \mbox {otherwise.}
    \end{cases}  \\
lloc_M(\lambda x . U) &= lloc_M(U) \\
lloc_M(U V) &= \begin{cases}
                lloc_M(U) &\mbox{if $lloc_M(U)\neq\bot$,} \\
                lloc_M(V) &\mbox{if $lloc_M(U)=\bot$ and $\lambda_l(U) = \epsilon$,} \\
                \bot & \mbox{if $lloc_M(U)=\bot$ and $\lambda_l(U) \neq \epsilon$.}
              \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where $v$ ranges over variable occurrences in $M$,
and for any subterm $N$, $lloc_M(N) = \bot$ denotes that $lloc$ is undefined at $N$.

The \defname{leftmost linear variable occurrence} of $M$
is defined as $lloc_M(M)$ if it exists and the generalized redex it is involved in is called the \defname{lloc redex}, otherwise $M$ is said to be in \defname{quasi normal form}, or \emph{qnf} for short.
The \defname{leftmost linear reduction} strategy, written $\llred$, is defined as the strategy that linearly fires the generalized redex involving the leftmost linear variable occurrence.
\end{definition}

Leftmost linear reduction proceeds by first locating the left-most variable occurrence and, if it is involved in a redex, linearly fires it. In comparison, the standard left-most outermost reduction strategy first locates the leftmost redex and then fires it by substituting all the variables involved in it.

Since the \emph{lloc} is uniquely defined, a given term has a unique left-most linear reduction sequence $M \llred M_1 \llred M_2 \llred \ldots$ (also abbreviated as \defname{linear reduction sequence}).

\begin{example}
Take $M = (\lambda x. x x N) z$. We have $M \hlred (\lambda x. z x N) z$ which is in quasi head normal form because the head variable $z$ is not involved in any generalized redex.
But since the left-most occurrence $x$ is involved in the redex $(\lambda x, z)$ the leftmost linear reduction gives $(\lambda x. z x N) z \llred (\lambda x. z z N) z$.
\end{example}

The \emph{lloc} generalizes the notion of \emph{hoc} to arguments of the head variable. Observe, however, that contrary to the \emph{hoc}, the definition requires the \emph{lloc} to be involved in a generalized redex.
\begin{example}In the term $M = (\lambda x y . z y x) (\lambda u . u) (\lambda v . v)$, the \emph{hoc} variable $z$ is not involved in any generalized redex, whereas the \emph{lloc} variable $y$ is involved in generalized redex $(\lambda y, (\lambda v.v))$.
\end{example}
On the other hand, if the \emph{hoc} is involved in a generalized redex then by definition it must coincide with the \emph{lloc}.

\begin{property}
If $M$ has a $\beta$-normal form and $\lambda_l(M) = \langle \lambda x_1 \ldots \lambda x_n \rangle$ then its beta-normal form starts with at least $n$ lambda abstractions, \ie, it is of the shape $\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n . M'$ for some beta-normal term $M'$, up to variable renaming.
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
From the definition of $\lambda_l$, capture-avoiding substitution can only increase the length of the head lambda list of the overall term: if the substituted variable occurs in head position in a context of the form $C[x U_1 \ldots U_n]$ then because the head lambda list of $x U_1 \ldots U_n$ is empty, after substituting $x$ with another term, the head lambda list of $x U_1 \ldots U_n$ can only get bigger. If $x$ is in operand position then by definition the head lambda list of the term is not altered. A structural induction permits to conclude.
Now if $M$ has a beta-normal form then the result follows by a straightforward induction on the length of the standard reduction sequence.
\end{proof}


\begin{property}
\label{prop:qnf_longapply}
    Let $M$ be an untyped term and $y A_1 \ldots A_n$ be a subterm of $M$ for $n\geq1$ where $y$ is a variable not involved in any generalized redex then:
    \begin{align*}
    lloc_M(y A_1 \ldots A_n) &=
        \begin{cases}
         lloc_M (A_j) &\mbox{ where } j = \min_{1\leq i\leq n} \{ i\, | \ lloc_M (A_i) \neq \bot\} \\
         \bot &\mbox{ if } lloc_M(A_i) = \bot \mbox{ for all } 1\leq i\leq n.
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
    Immediate from the definition of $lloc$ since $\lambda_l(y) = \epsilon$.
\end{proof}

We say that a standard redex $(\lambda x. N) A$ is \defname{trivial} if $x$ does not occur freely in $N$ in which case the redex can be \emph{trivially reduced} to just $N$.

\begin{property}
\label{prop:lloc_properties}
Some immediate properties:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\roman*)]
\item
 If $N$ is a subterm of $M$ then $lloc_N(N) \sqsubseteq lloc_M(N)$;
\item
 If $M$ is beta-normal then $lloc_M(M) = \bot$;
 \item
 If $U V$ is in quasi normal form then so is $U$;
\item
 If $\lambda x . U$ is in quasi normal form then so is $U$;
 \item If $M$ has a \emph{lloc} redex then $M$ has a redex;
 \item If all the redexes in $M$ are trivial then $M$ is in \emph{qnf}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
(i) Immediate from the fact that generalized redexes of $N$ are also generalized redexes of $M$. (ii) If $lloc_M(M) \neq \bot$ then $M$ must contain a generalized redex and therefore must also contain a standard redex hence $M$ is not beta-normal.
(iii) If $U V$ is in quasi normal form then $lloc_{UV}(UV) = \bot$ so by definition of $lloc$ we must have $lloc_{UV}(U) = \bot$. By (i) since $U$ is a subterm of $UV$ this implies $lloc_{UV}(U) = \bot$.
(iv) We have $\bot = lloc_{\lambda x . U}(\lambda x . U) = lloc_{\lambda x . U}(U) \sqsupseteq lloc_{U}(U)$.
(v) and (vi) are immediate from the definition of \emph{lloc} redex.
\end{proof}

The following example shows that the converse of (vi) does not hold:
\begin{example}
Take $M= (\lambda z.u)((\lambda x . x) y)$. Then $lloc_M(M) = \bot$ since $\lambda_l(\lambda z.y)\ne\epsilon$ and $lloc_M(\lambda z.u) = \bot$.
So $M$ is in quasi-normal form, even though it has a non-trivial redex in the argument $(\lambda x . x) y$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Arguments of the hoc]
Let $z$ be the \emph{hoc} of $M$. The arguments of the \emph{hoc} occurrence, written ${\sf Args}(M)$, is a list of subterms of $M$ defined by induction:
\begin{align*}
{\sf Args}(z) &= \epsilon \\
{\sf Args}(\lambda x . U ) &= {\sf Args}(U) \\
{\sf Args}(U V) &= \begin{cases}
             {\sf Args}(U) \cdot V & \mbox{if } \lambda_l(U) = \epsilon\\
             {\sf Args}(U)         & \mbox{if } \lambda_l(U) \neq \epsilon
            \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Note that the variable case where $x\neq z$ is not needed since the induction proceeds by spinal descent to the head occurrence.
\end{definition}

\begin{property}
\label{property:hoc_argument_count_in_headnf}
    If $M$ is in quasi-head-normal form, then the head variable of its head-normal form has precisely $|{\sf Args}(M)|$ arguments.
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:danosregnier_headlinred}, the \emph{hoc} of a quasi-head normal form becomes the head variable of the head-normal form after reducing the prime redexes, and it is easy to show by structural induction that standard beta-reduction preserves the number of pending hoc arguments.
\end{proof}

We now introduce a $\beta$-reduction strategy (in the standard sense).
We define the \defname{leftmost spinal-innermost} standard $\beta$-redex of $M$ as the $\beta$-redex $(\lambda x . N) A$ such that there is no other redex in $M$ occurring left of it and such that $N$ contains no other redex; the argument $A$ on the other-hand, may contain other redexes.
The idea consists in reducing $M$'s redexes in `inside-out left-to-right' order.
This definition should be distinguished from the \emph{leftmost innermost} reduction strategy from the lambda calculus literature.
In particular $(\lambda x . y) \Omega$ reduces to $y$ with the leftmost spinal-innermost strategy, while the leftmost innermost strategy does not terminate.
% See http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/classes/fa17/coms3261/lec/L24-Lambda_Calculus_II.html: the leftmost innermost strategy reduces any redex in the argument first, whereas here the "inner" only refers to the body of the operator.

% NOTE: may be related to the `hybrid normal order reduction'
% or `head spine reduction` of Paulson.

\begin{proposition}[Trivial reduction of quasi normal forms]
\label{prop:qnf_nf}
Let $M$ be a term in \emph{qnf}.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
% \item[(X)] If $x$ is a variable occurrence in $M$ involved in a generalized redex of $M$ then $x$ occurs in operand position in a subterm of the form:
% $$(\lambda z .U) A_1 \ldots A_q (\ldots x \ldots) \qquad q\geq 0$$
\item[(i)]
 If $M$ is not in beta-normal form then its \emph{leftmost spinal-innermost standard $\beta$-redex} $(\lambda x . N) A$ is trivial.
(\ie, $x$ does not occur freely in $N$).

\item[(ii)] $M$ has a beta-normal form and the leftmost spinal-innermost strategy normalizes $M$.

\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\proofatend
\begin{compactitem}
% \item[(X)] By induction on $M$. Suppose $M = v$ for some variable $v$ then the result trivially holds since $M$ has no generalized redex. Suppose $M = \lambda x . U$ then by Property~\ref{prop:lloc_properties}(iv) $U$ is in \emph{qnf} and we conclude by the induction hypothesis.

%     Suppose $M = U V$. If $x$ occurs in $U$ then we conclude by the induction hypothesis ($U$ is in \emph{qnf} by Property~\ref{prop:lloc_properties}(iii)). If $x$ occurs in $V$ then if $V$ is in \emph{qnf} we conclude by the induction hypothesis. Otherwise by definition of $lloc$ we necessarily have $\lambda_l(U) \neq \epsilon$. Hence $U$ is either an abstraction or a redex with possibly multiple applied arguments. Consequently, so is $UV$ which proves (i).
\item[(i)]
By induction on $M$. Suppose $M = (\lambda x . N) A$. By assumption $N$ is in beta-normal form therefore if $x$ occurs freely in $N$ it is involved in the generalized redex $(\lambda x, A)$ of $M$ and by bottom-up evaluation of $lloc$ this gives $lloc_M(M) = x$ which contradict the assumption that $M$ is in \emph{qnf}.

Suppose $M = \lambda z . U$ then $U$ is in \emph{qnf} by Property~\ref{prop:lloc_properties}(iv) and the result follows by the induction hypothesis
since the redexes of $M$ are those of $U$ and the free variables of $M$ are a subset of those of $U$.

Suppose $M = U V$. We consider the three sub-cases depending on where the redex is located within $U V$:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item[(1)] The redex $(\lambda x . N) A$  is in $U$. Since $M$ is in \emph{qnf}, by Property~\ref{prop:lloc_properties}(iii) so is $U$, we can thus conclude by the induction hypothesis.

  \item[(2)] The redex $(\lambda x . N) A$  is in $V$.
If $\lambda_l(U) = \epsilon$ then by definition of $lloc$ we have $lloc_M(UV) = lloc_M(V) = \bot$ so we conclude by the induction hypothesis.
If $\lambda_l(U) \neq \epsilon$, then either $U$ contains a redex or $U$ is an abstraction. But $U$ cannot be a redex since by assumption $N$ does not contain any redex, and $U$ being abstraction would make $M = U V$ itself a redex which would contradict the fact that redex $(\lambda x . N) A$ in $V$ is the leftmost redex in $M$.

  \item[(3)] $U = \lambda x . N$ and $V = A$. This is the base case of the induction already treated above.
\end{compactitem}

\item[(ii)]
By (i) each reduction of the leftmost spinal-innermost reduction strategy is trivial and it is easy to see that $lloc$ is preserved by trivial reduction, therefore each term in the reduction sequence is in \emph{qnf}.
Since a trivial reduction cannot possibly create new $\beta$-redexes, the reduction sequence necessarily terminates and yields the beta-normal form.
\end{compactitem}
\endproofatend

Observe that if $M$ is in \emph{qnf}, its redexes are not all necessarily trivial, but the non-trivial redexes get eliminated by the trivial reductions:
\begin{example}
The term $M = (\lambda x . u) ((\lambda z .z) y)$ is in \emph{qnf} and trivially reduces to $u$ but contains the non-trivial redex $(\lambda z .z) y$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Take $M = (\lambda x . z ((\lambda w y . y)x)) U$ for any term $U$.
    Then $M$ is in quasi-head normal form with one prime spine redex $(x,U)$.
    Performing one head reduction gives $M \rightarrow_h z ((\lambda w y. y) U)$
    which brings the \emph{hoc} in head position.
$M$ is also in quasi normal form. Indeed $lloc_M(M) = lloc_M (\lambda w y . y) = \bot$. Reducing the term with the leftmost spinal-innermost reduction strategy gives  $M \rightarrow (\lambda x . z (\lambda y . y)) U
    \rightarrow  z (\lambda y . y) $ which yields a beta-normal form.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Soundness of leftmost linear reduction]
\label{thm:soundness_leftmostlinearred}
If $M \rightarrow_{l} N$ then $M$ and $N$ are beta-equivalent.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is like that of Theorem~\ref{thm:danosregnier_headlinred}. We adapt the notion of \emph{consecutive redex} from~\cite{danos-head} to  leftmost-linear reduction: Let $r = (\lambda x, V)$ and  $s =(\lambda y, W)$ be two generalized redexes. We say that $r$ contains $s$ if the node $\lambda y$ lies in the scope of $\lambda x$. We say that $r$ and $s$ are \emph{consecutive} if $r$ contains $s$; no other generalized redex other than $r$ and $s$ is contained in $r$ and contains $s$; and $s$ is the leftmost generalized redex contained in $r$ (\ie, any other redex $t$ contained in $r$ resides on the left of node $\lambda y$ in the usual tree representation of the term). Let $r_0, \ldots, r_p$ denote the consecutive generalized redexes for $p\geq 0$ where $r_0$ is not contained in any other generalized redexes and $r_p$ is the \emph{lloc redex}. (This sequence necessarily exists by definition of \emph{lloc}.) An induction on $p$ shows that $M$ and $N$ reduce to the same term by exactly $p-1$ standard reduction steps (\ie, the strategy reducing the leftmost outermost redex), observing that at every step, no redex can be introduced above or on the left of the \emph{lloc}.
\end{proof}

% REMARK: We chose to prove the following termination result directly, and use it in the next section to show that normalizing traversals are necessarily finite. Observe that if we were to show independently that traversals are finite, the following theorem would follow from it.

\begin{property}
\label{property:lambdalist_linearred}
    Let $M_1, M_2$ be two lambda terms.
    \begin{enumerate*}[noitemsep,label=(\roman*)]
        \item If $M_1 \rightarrow_\beta M_2$ then $|\lambda_l(M_2)| \geq
        |\lambda_l(M_1)|$;
        \item If $M_1 \llred M_2$ then $|\lambda_l(M_2)| \geq
        |\lambda_l(M_1)|$;
        \item If $M_1$ trivially reduces to $M_2$ then $\lambda_l(M_2) =
        \lambda_l(M_1)$.
    \end{enumerate*}
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
    (i) and (ii) Performing substitution in an operand of an application does not affect its lambda-list; while substituting a variable in operator position in the application, effectively appends the lambda-list of the substituted term to the lambda-list of the application.
    (iii) follows trivially by definition of $\lambda_l$.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
Take $M_1 = (\lambda x . x) (\lambda y z . y)$. We have $\lambda_l(M_1) = \epsilon$ but $M \rightarrow_\beta \lambda y z . y = M_2$,
$M_1 \llred (\lambda x . (\lambda y z . y)) (\lambda y z . y) = M_3$ and
and $\lambda_l(M_2) = \lambda_l(M_3) = (\lambda y, \lambda z)$.
Take $N = (\lambda x . U) V$ where $x$ does not occur in $U$ then $N$ trivially reduces to $U$ and $\lambda_l(N) = \lambda_l(U)$.
\end{example}

\begin{property}
\label{prop:qnf_betanf_empty_lambdalist}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\roman*)]
    \item If $M$ is in beta-nf and $\lambda_l(M) = \epsilon$ then $M$ is not an abstraction.
    \item If $M$ is in \emph{qnf} and $M$ has a beta-nf then its beta-normal form is not an abstraction.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
(i) If $M$ were an abstraction $\lambda x. N$ we would have $\lambda_l(M) = \lambda x$ which contradicts the assumption.
(ii) By Proposition\ref{prop:qnf_nf}(ii), we have that $M$ trivially reduces to
its beta-nf so by Property~\ref{property:lambdalist_linearred},
$M$ and its normal form must have the same lambda list. We can then conclude using (i).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness of leftmost linear reduction]
\label{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred}
If $M$ has a beta-normal form then its left-most linear reduction terminates (and thus yields a quasi normal form).
\end{theorem}
The technical proof is in appendix.
\begin{todobox}
    include snippet of proof
\end{todobox}
\proofatend
Suppose $M$ has a beta-normal form then by a standard result of lambda calculus its head-reduction terminates, therefore by Theorem~\ref{thm:danosregnier_headlinred} the $\hlred$-reduction of $M$ terminates and yields its quasi-\emph{head}-normal form. Since $\hlred$ coincides with $\llred$, for terms not in \emph{qhnf}, we can without loss of generality assume that $M$ is in \emph{qhnf}.
We prove by induction on the \emph{size} of $M$ that
\begin{quote}
{\bf (H1)} If $M$ has a beta-nf then its linear reduction sequence terminates.
\end{quote}
For the variable case, $\llred$ trivially terminates.
If $M = \lambda x . U$ then $U$ must also admit a beta-nf so we can conclude by induction. Suppose $M = U V$. If $M$ is in \emph{qnf} then we conclude immediately. Otherwise, $M$ must have a \emph{lloc} occurrence that is distinct from the \emph{hoc} occurrence.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\roman*),leftmargin=1pc]
\item Suppose that the \emph{lloc} of $M$ is in $U$ ($lloc_M(U) \ne \bot$).
    We show by finite \emph{structural} induction on subterms $T$ of $U$ that:
    \begin{quote}
    {\bf (H2)} If $lloc_M(T) \neq \bot$ and $hoc(M)$ is in $T$ then there are at most a finite number of steps in the linear reduction sequence of $M$ that involve a linear substitutions in (reducts of) $T$.
    \end{quote}

    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,leftmargin=0pt,label=-]
        \item $T$ is a variable. Since $M$'s \hoc\ is in $T$, it must be $T$ itself. Because $M$ is in quasi-head-normal form, the \hoc~is not involved in any generalized redex and therefore $T$ is not involved in any substitution of the linear reduction sequence of $M$.

        \item $T =\lambda x . T'$ then the \emph{hoc} and \emph{lloc} must be in $T'$ and we can conclude by the induction hypothesis (H2).

        \item $T = T_1 T_2$. By definition, the \emph{hoc} is necessarily in $T_1$.

        \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\alph*)]

            \item Suppose that $\emph{lloc}$ is in $T_2$. Then we have $lloc_M(T_1) =\bot$ therefore none of the steps in the linear reduction sequence of $M$ will involve substitutions in $T_1$ (there is no  variable in $T_1$ involved in a  general redex therefore subsequent linear reduction steps can only introduce general redexes on the right of $T_1$).

            \begin{compactitem}
                \item Suppose $T_1$ is a variable $x$ then it must be the \emph{hoc} and we have $T = x~T_2$.

                    We show the result by induction (H3) on the number of pending arguments of the \emph{hoc}.

                    \begin{compactitem}
                    \item Base: $z$ has a single argument which must be $T_2$.

                    By Theorem~\ref{thm:danosregnier_headlinred}, reducing all the prime redexes in $M$ yields its head-normal form
                    with $x$ as the head variable.
                    Let $\gamma$ denotes the sequence of substitutions performed on $M$ to reduce the prime redexes, so that $\gamma(M)$ is the head normal form of $M$.
                    Then $\gamma(T_2)$ will becomes the (unique) argument of $x$ in the head normal form. And because $M$ has a beta-nf, the term $\gamma(T_2)$ must also have a beta-nf.

                    Because $z$ has a single hoc argument, all the subsequent linear substitutions in $M$ must necessarily occur under $T_2$ and its reducts: the \emph{lloc} will never get out of $T_2$.
                    (Indeed, otherwise by the inductive definition of \emph{lloc} there would be a subterm $U' V'$ of $M$ where $U'$ contains $z T_2$ and $\lambda_l(U;) \neq \epsilon$, which by definition of {\sf Args} would imply that $V'$ is another hoc argument, contradicting the assumption that the hoc has a single argument.)

                    Therefore if we consider the term $M'$ obtained by replacing
                    the subterm $T$ by just $T_2$, the $\llred$-reduction sequence of $M$ coincides with that of $M'$.

                    Now $M'$ must necessarily have a beta-normal form. Otherwise it's standard beta-reduction sequence would not terminate, which would imply that $\gamma(T_2)$ does not terminate, which contradicts the fact that $\gamma(T_2)$ is the argument of the head variable in the head normal form!

                    Thus, since $M'$ is by definition smaller than $M$,by the induction hypothesis H1, its linear-reduction sequence terminates. We can then conclude since we have shown that
                    the linear reduction sequences of $M$ and $M'$ coincide.

                    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
                    \item Inductive case: suppose the result holds for terms with $n \geq 1$ \hoc\ arguments, and suppose ${\sf Args}(M) = n+1$.

                    Let $U_{n+1} V_{n+1}$ denote the subterm of $M$ such that $V_{n+1}$ is the last \hoc\ argument of $M$. We consider the term $M'$ obtained from $M$ by removing the last \hoc\ argument of $M$ (\ie~replacing $U_{n+1} V_{n+1}$ by $U_{n+1}$).
                    Observe that the last argument of the hoc cannot be possibly be argument of any generalized redex, therefore the linear reduction of $M$ must  coincide with that of $M'$ up until the \hoc\ of the reduct of $M$ lies under the last \hoc\ argument $U_{n+1}$.

                    By induction hypothesis (H3), the $\llred$-reductions sequences of $M'$ involves a finite number of substitutions under $T_2$. Consequently, the same holds in $M$.
                    \end{compactitem}

            % \begin{todobox}
            % Where do we use Property \ref{property:hoc_argument_count_in_headnf} ?
            % \end{todobox}

                \item  Suppose $T_1$ is not a variable. Let $z$ denote a fresh variable in $M$, and $M' = M[z/T_1]$ be the term obtained by replacing the subterm $T_1$ in $M$ by the fresh variable $z$.

                Since $T_1$ is not a variable, $M'$ must be strictly smaller than $M$. And since $M$ has a beta-nf, so must $M'$, thus by the induction hypothesis (H1), the $\llred$ reduction sequence of $M'$ terminates. Consequently, there is only a finite number of steps in the linear reduction of $M'$ that involve substitutions in reducts of $z~T_2$.

                Clearly, the linear reduction steps under $T_2$ in $M'$ coincide with those of $T_2$ in $M$. Hence, we can conclude that at most a finite number of substitutions take place under $T= T_1 T_2$ in the linear reduction sequence of $M$.
            \end{compactitem}


            \item Suppose that $\emph{lloc}$ is in $T_1$. Then by the induction hypothesis (H2) there is a finite number of steps in the linear reduction sequence of $M$ that involve (reducts of) $T_1$. Let us consider the first reduct $R$ of $M$ in the $\llred$ reduction sequence such that the \emph{lloc} is not under a reduct of $T_1$.  Observe that in the linear reduction sequence of $T$, the subterm $T_2$ remains unmodified as long as the \emph{lloc} remains in (the reduct) of $T_1$.

            At $R$, if the \emph{lloc} is not under $T_2$ then none of the further steps in the linear reduction sequence of $R$ will involve $T_2$ (\ie, subsequent substitutions will occur outside of $T$ -- on its right,  more precisely). We can therefore conclude.

            If instead at $R$ the \emph{lloc} lies under the subterm $T_2$: $lloc_R(T2) \ne\bot$, then $T_1$ cannot be a variable, otherwise it would be both the \emph{hoc} and the \emph{lloc} of $M$ which contradict the assumption. We can therefore conclude by applying the same reasoning as case (a) above to the reduct $R$.
        \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \item Suppose that the lloc is in $V$.
    Then by definition of the \emph{lloc} for the application case, we must have $lloc_M(U) =\bot$ and $\lambda_l(U)=\epsilon$.
    Hence $U$ is a term in \emph{qnf} and by Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_nf} it must
    have a beta-normal form. By Property~\ref{prop:qnf_betanf_empty_lambdalist}
    $U$'s normal form is not an abstraction. Hence since $M$ has a normal form so must $V$ and we have $\betanf{M} = \betanf{U} \betanf{V}$.
    By the induction hypothesis (H1) the $\llred$-reduction of $V$ must terminate.
    We can then conclude by observing that the linear-substitutions performed in the
    linear-reduction sequence of $M$ map one-to-one to those in the linear-reduction sequence of $V$ (\ie, if $V \llred V_2 \llred \ldots V_i$ then $M = U V \llred U V_2 \llred \ldots U V_i$ for some $i\geq 0$)

\section{Correctness of ULC evaluation}
\label{sec:correctness_ulc_normalization}
Correctness of the evaluation procedure relies, like in the STLC case, on a Path Characterization Theorem.
Unlike STLC, however, we prove this characterization without appealing to Game Semantics, since we have not formally established the game denotation correspondence for ULC.
The proof proceeds instead by showing that $\sim$-equivalence classes are preserved by \emph{leftmost-linear reduction} (Section~\ref{sec:leftmostlinearred}). It is based on a bisimulation argument requiring careful analysis of the traversals structure.


\begin{definition}
    \label{def:spinaldescent_pendingarglookup}
A subsequence of a traversal is a
\begin{enumerate*}[nosep,label=(\roman*)]
\item \defname{spinal descent} if it is a path in the computation tree consisting solely of structural lambda and $@$-nodes, and where each lambda node (except the first occurrence if it is a lambda node) is the $0$th child of the preceding $@$-node.
\item \defname{pending argument lookup} if it consists of an alternation of ghost lambda nodes and ghost variables nodes, starting with an external ghost lambda node and terminated by a structural internal lambda node in $\NodesLmd$.
\item \defname{branching descent} if it consists of an alternation of external structural lambda nodes and external structural variable nodes.
\end{enumerate*}
\end{definition}

%For any node $n$ of the tree of $M$ we write $M^{(n)}$ for the subterm of $M$ rooted at $n$, and $lloc_M(n)$ to denote $lloc_M(M^{(n)})$.
\begin{definition}[lloc of a node]
For any tree node $n$ we write $lloc_M(n)$ to denote $lloc_M(N)$ where $N$ is the subterm of $M$ rooted at $n$ and $lloc$ denotes the leftmost linear occurrence from Definition~\ref{def:leftmostlinearreduction}.
\end{definition}
%We say that a traversal $t$ is \defname{head-normal} if it ends with a structural lambda node with undefined lloc (\ie, $t^\omega = \lambda\overline\eta$ and $lloc_M(t^\omega) = \bot$).

\begin{property}
\label{prop:strand_spinaldescent}
Let $t$ be a traversal of $M$ and $u$ be a subsequence of $t$ of the form
$u = \underline{\lambda \overline{x}} \cdot v \cdot \underline{x}$
for some subsequence $v$ of $t$, external structural variable node $x$ and external structural lambda node $\lambda \overline{x}$.
If $v$ is empty then the node following $u$ in $t$, if it exists, is necessarily a structural child lambda node of $x$ (\ie, it cannot be a ghost node).
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
 If $v$ is empty then the strand ending at $x$
 is just $\underline{\lambda \overline{x}} \cdot \underline{x}$ therefore
 $t$'s arity threshold is precisely $|x|$, in which case rule \rulenamet{IVar} can only visit a structural child of $x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Strand types]
    \label{def:strandtypes} We distinguish two types of strands:
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item Structural argument strands (S) of the form $\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta}} \cdot u \cdot \underline{x}$
            where
            \begin{itemize}[nosep]
            \item $\lambda\overline{\eta}$ is an external structural lambda node verifying $lloc_M(\lambda\overline\eta) = \bot$,
            \item $u$ is a (possibly empty) \emph{spinal descents} of internal nodes,
            \item $x$ is an external structural variable node;
            \end{itemize}

        \item Ghost argument strands ($G$) of the form $\underline{\ghostlmd} \cdot  v \cdot \lambda\overline{y} \cdot u \cdot \underline{x}$
        where
        \begin{itemize}[nosep]
            \item $\ghostlmd$ is an external ghost lambda node,
            \item $v$ is a \emph{pending parameter lookup} (ghost nodes) of length shorter than $u$,
            \item $\lambda\overline{y}$ is an internal lambda node verifying $lloc_M(\lambda\overline{y}) = \bot$,
            \item $x$ is an external structural variable node.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Quasi-normal forms strand decomposition]
\label{prop:qnf_strand_decomposition}
Any maximal traversal $t_{\max}$ of a \emph{qnf} $M$
consists of a succession of $S$ and $G$ strands determined by the following transition system with states $\{ S, G \}$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|ll l}
State (strand type) & Transition & Current strand & Next strand \\
\hline \hline
Initial state & $\rightarrow S$ & $\epsilon$ & $\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta_1}} \cdot u_1 \cdot \underline{x_1}$ \\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{S} & $S \rightarrow G$ & \multirow{2}{*}{$\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta_1}} \cdot u_1 \cdot \underline{x_1} $}
& $\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta_2}} \cdot u_2 \cdot \underline{x_2}$  \\
& $S \rightarrow S$ & & $\underline{\ghostlmd} \cdot  v \cdot \lambda\overline{y_2} \cdot u_2 \cdot \underline{x_2}$ \\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{G} & $G \rightarrow S$ & \multirow{2}{*}{$\underline{\ghostlmd} \cdot  v \cdot \lambda\overline{y_1} \cdot u_1 \cdot \underline{x_1}$}
& $\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta_2}} \cdot u_2 \cdot \underline{x_2}$
\\
  & $G \rightarrow G$ & & $\underline{\ghostlmd} \cdot v \cdot \lambda\overline{y_2} \cdot u_2 \cdot \underline{x_2}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
where $\lambda\overline{y_2}$ is justified by a $@$-node in $u_1$.
\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
\proofatend
By case analysis on the current state:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(Init)] The first strand is obtained by applying the rule \rulenamet{Root} followed by repeated applications of \rulenamet{App} and \rulenamet{Lam}, which yields $u$, a path from the root $\lambda\overline{\eta}$ to some variable node $x$ in the tree of $M$, so that $u$ is a spinal descent consisting only of lambda nodes and application nodes.
Suppose that $x$ is an internal variable then by definition it is
involved in some generalized redex and therefore we have $lloc_M(\underline{\lambda\eta}) = x$, but since $M$ is in \emph{qnf} we have $lloc_M(\lambda \overline{\eta}) = lloc_M(M) = \bot$ which gives a contradiction.
Hence $x$ is an external variable which ends the first strand of type $S$.

\item[(Structural)] The previous strand is of form $\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta_1}} \cdot u_1 \cdot \underline{x_1} $.

If the node following $x_1$ is a structural node $\lambda\overline{\eta_2}$ then by rule \rulenamet{IVar}, it's a child lambda node of $x_1$.
Because $u_1$ is a spinal descent, the subterm rooted at $\lambda \overline\eta_1$ is of the form $\lambda \overline\eta_1 . x_1 A_1 \ldots A_q$ for some $q\geq1$, therefore we have $lloc_M(\lambda \overline\eta_1 . x_1 A_1 \ldots A_q) = \bot$. Since $x_1$ is external, by Property~\ref{prop:qnf_longapply} we have $lloc_M(A_j)=\bot$ for all $1\leq j\leq q$, so in particular $lloc_M(\lambda\overline{\eta_2}) = \bot$. The same logic used in the \emph{Initialization} case lets us conclude that $u_2$ is a spinal descent to external node $x_2$. We have shown that the next strand is of type $S$.
\\

Now suppose instead that the node following $x_1$ is a ghost node then by Property~\ref{prop:strand_spinaldescent}, $u_1$ is necessarily non-empty: we have $u_1 =
@_1 \cdot\lambda\overline{\xi_1} \cdots @_q\cdot \lambda\overline{\xi_q}$ for some $q\geq 1$. The subterm at $@_r$,  represented on Figure~\ref{fig:strand_decomposition_proof_induction}, is of the form
$$(\lambda\overline{\xi_r}. A_0) A_1 \ldots A_{k_{r}-1}\ (\lambda\overline{y_2}. \ldots)A_{k_{r}+1}\ \ldots A_{|@_r|} .$$
By the weaving property of Proposition~\ref{prop:weaving}(iii), $x_1$ is followed by a \emph{pending parameter lookup} $v$ necessarily shorter than $u_1$ and terminated by a structural lambda node $\lambda\overline{y_2}$ justified by some application node $@_r$ in $u_1$ for some $1\leq r \leq q$:
\begin{align*}
 t &= \cdots \Pstr[10pt]{
(l){\underline{\lambda\overline{\eta}}} \cdot
{@_1} \cdot \lambda\overline{\xi_1} \cdot
\cdots
(atr){@_r} \lambda\overline{\xi_r} \cdot
\cdots
{@_q} \cdot\lambda\overline{\xi_q} \cdot
(x){\underline{x}}\cdot
(gl-x,25:k){\underline\ghostlmd}
\cdot v
\cdot
(ly-atr,25:k_r){\lambda\overline{y_2}}
 } \\
v &= \ghostvar_{k_q} \cdot \ghostlmd_{k_q} \cdot
\ghostvar_{k_{q-1}} \cdot \ghostlmd_{k_{q-1}} \cdot
\cdots
\ghostvar_{k_{r-1}} \cdot \ghostlmd_{k_{r-1}} \cdot
\ghostvar_{k_{r}}
\end{align*}
where, for all $i$ ranging from $r$ to $q$, ghost variable
$\ghostvar_{k_i}$ and ghost lambda $\ghostlmd_{k_i}$ point respectively to $\lambda\overline{\xi_i}$ and $@_i$ with label $k_i\geq1$ defined by:
\begin{align*}
  k_i &= k - |x| + |\lambda\overline{\xi}_q| + \sum_{i\leq j < q} (|\lambda\overline{\xi}_{j}| - |@_{j+1}|)
%\\
%  k_j &= k + |\lambda\overline{\xi}_q| - |x| +
%  \sum_{i=j..q-1} |\lambda\overline{\xi}_{i}|
%  - \sum_{i=j..q-1} |@_{i+1}|
%\\
%  k_j &= k + |\lambda\overline{\xi}_q| - |x| +
%  \sum_{i=j..q-1} |\lambda\overline{\xi}_{i}|
%  - \sum_{i=j+1..q} |@_{i}|
%\\
%  k_j &= k + |\lambda\overline{\xi}_q| - |x| +
%  |\lambda\overline{\xi}_{j}| +
%  \sum_{i=j+1..q-1} (|\lambda\overline{\xi}_{i}| - |@_{i}|) - |@_{q}|
\\
   &= k - |x| +
  |\lambda\overline{\xi}_{i}| +
  \sum_{i< j\leq q} (|\lambda\overline{\xi}_j| - |@_j|)
\end{align*}

Since all the nodes in $v$ are ghost nodes, by Proposition~\ref{prop:ulctrav_welldefined_pathview} their justification label is greater than the justifier's arity; the opposite holds for $\lambda\overline{y_2}$ which is a structural node. Therefore:
\begin{align}
k > |x| \label{eqn:k_greater_than_x} \\
k_i > |@_i| & \quad\mbox{for all $r+1\leq i \leq q$ } \label{eqn:qnfdecomp_kj}\\
k_r \leq |@_r|
\end{align}


To prove that $lloc(\lambda\overline{y_2}) =\bot$ we first show that for all $i$ ranging from $r+1$ to $q$ we have
 $k_i>|\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})|$. We prove the result by a finite induction proceeding bottom-up from the lower tree node
 $\lambda\overline{\xi_q}$ up to $\lambda\overline{\xi_r}$.

\emph{Base case:} We have $i=q$. The subterm
rooted at $\lambda\overline{\xi_q}$ is in head normal form
$\lambda\overline{\xi_q}. x \cdots$ therefore its head lambda-list consists precisely of the lambda abstractions $\lambda\overline{\xi_q}$, and thus
$|\lambda_s(\lambda\overline{\xi_q})| = |\lambda\overline{\xi_q}|$.
We have $k_q = k -|x| + |\lambda\overline{\xi_q}|$ and by Equation~\ref{eqn:k_greater_than_x} we have $k>|x|$, hence $k_q >|\lambda\overline{\xi_q}|$.


\emph{Induction case:} Let $r+1\leq i \leq q$. We suppose that the result holds for $i$ we show that it must hold for $i-1$. By definition, the head lambda-list at $\lambda\overline{\xi_i}$ is precisely given by the variables in the abstraction concatenated with the head lambda-list at $@_{i+1}$, thus $|\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})| =
|\lambda\overline{\xi_i}| + |\lambda_l(@_{i+1})|$. The lambda-list at $@_i$, is by definition, obtained by popping $|@_i|$ lambdas from the lambda-list at $\lambda\overline{\xi_i}$; or is the empty list if the arity is greater than the number of pending lambdas. In terms of lengths this means:
\begin{align*}
    |\lambda_l(@_i)| &= \max(0, |\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})| - |@_i|) \\
     &= \max\left( 0, |\lambda_l(@_{i+1})| + |\lambda\overline{\xi_i}| - |@_i| \right) & \mbox{for $r\leq i \leq q-1$.}
\end{align*}

Furthermore by definition of $k_{i-1}$ we have:
\begin{equation}
k_{i-1} = k_i + |\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}}| - |@_i| \label{eqn:ki_minus_one}
\end{equation}
Hence,
\begin{align*}
    |\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}})| - k_{i-1}
    &= |\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}}| +|\lambda_l(@_i)| - k_{i-1} &\mbox{(Def~of $\lambda_l$)}\\
    &= |\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}}| + \max\left( 0, |\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})| - |@_i| \right) - k_{i-1} &\mbox{(Def~of $\lambda_l$)}\\
    &= \max\left( |\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}}| - k_{i-1},    |\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}}| + |\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})| - |@_i| - k_{i-1} \right) \\
    &= \max\left(  |@_i|- k_i, |\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})| - k_i \right) &\mbox{(Eqn~\ref{eqn:ki_minus_one})}
\end{align*}
By the induction hypothesis we have $|\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_i})| < k_i$, and by Equation~\ref{eqn:qnfdecomp_kj} we have $ |@_i|< k_i$, therefore the maximum of the two quantities in the last equation is negative which shows
the desired result $|\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_{i-1}})| < k_{i-1}$.

We now show that $lloc_M(\lambda\overline{y_2})=\bot$.
By assumption we have that $lloc_M(\lambda\overline{\eta}) =\bot$ so since $@_r$ occurs in the spine of $M$, by definition of $lloc_M$ we must have $lloc_M(@_r) =\bot$, and thus also $lloc_M(\lambda\overline{\xi_r}) = \bot$. We have just shown that $|\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{\xi_r}| < k_r$, consequently, the sub-term $(\lambda\overline{\xi_r} . A_0) A_1 \ldots A_{k_r-1}$ has more operands than pending lambdas in the operator's lambda list. By definition of lambda list this implies that $\lambda_l((\lambda\overline{\xi_r} . A_0) A_1 \ldots A_{k_r-1})$ is empty. Hence, we necessarily have $lloc(\lambda\overline{y_2}) = \bot$, otherwise by definition of $lloc$ we would have
 $lloc((\lambda\overline{\xi_r} . A_0) A_1 \ldots A_{k_r-1} (\lambda\overline{y_2}. \ldots)) = lloc(\lambda\overline{y_2}) \ne \bot$, which subsequently implies $lloc(\lambda\overline{\eta_1})\ne\bot$, contradicting the assumption.
The sequence $u_2$ is shown to be a spinal descent by the same argument used in the \emph{structural argument} case above, using the fact that $lloc_M(\lambda\overline{y_2})=\bot$. We have thus shown that the next strand is of type $G$.

\item[(Ghost)] If the node following $x_1$ is a structural node then, like we have shown in the previous case, the next strand is necessarily a spinal descent of type $S$.

If the node following $x_1$ is a ghost.
Once again, the weaving property shows that the ghost node after $x_1$ is necessarily followed by a \emph{pending parameter lookup} terminated by structural lambda node $\lambda\overline{y_2}$ pointing to some node in $v \cdot \lambda\overline{y_1} \cdot u_1$.
But since $v$ consists solely of ghost node, the justifier is necessarily in $u_1$. We can thus conclude with the same argument as in the previous case that the next strand is necessarily of type
$G$.

Figure~\ref{fig:qnf_strand_decomposition_statemachine} represents the more fine-grained state machine underpinning the stand decomposition result. It has three states representing each possible type of external node: lambda, ghost lambda or input variable. The bottom two states correspond to the start of a new strand in the traversal. The solid-arrows represent consecutive applications of deterministic traversal rules while dashed-arrows represent the two possible non-deterministic choices in rule \rulenamet{IVar}: one for structural child lambda nodes (left) and one for ghost children (right).

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:qnf_traversals_are_finite}
Let $t \in \travsetnorm(M)$ for some \emph{quasi normal} term $M$. We have:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), nosep]
\item $lloc_M(\alpha) = \bot$ for all external lambda node $\alpha \in \NodesLmd$ occurring in $t$.
\item $t$ does not contain any internal variable node (\ie, all the internal nodes are $@$ nodes);
\item $t$ is finite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
(a) and (b) are direct consequences of Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_strand_decomposition}.
For (c), let's consider each case of the strand decomposition of Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_strand_decomposition}. For transitions $\rightarrow S$ and $S \rightarrow S$, because $u_1$ and $u_2$ are spinal descents, the last node in the next strand ($x_1$ or $x_2$) must be a descendant (in the computation tree of $M$) of the first node ($\lambda\overline{\eta_1}$) from the previous strand.
For transition $S\rightarrow G$, since both $u_1$ and $u_2$ are spinal descents, there are also paths in the tree, therefore since $\lambda\overline{y_2}$ points to $u_1$, $x_2$ must also be a descendant of $\lambda\overline{\eta_1}$. For transitions $G \rightarrow S$ and $G \rightarrow G$, since $u_1$ and $u_2$ are spinal descents, $x_2$ is a descendant of $\lambda\overline{y_2}$, itself a descendant of $\lambda\overline{y_1}$.

Suppose $t$ is infinite then from the above strand decomposition we can construct an infinite path in the tree of $M$ which contradicts the fact that $M$ is a finitary term.
\end{proof}


%For any variable occurrence $x$ involved in a generalized redex $(\lambda x, A)$ for some subterm $A$, we will write $arg(x)$ to denote the root node of the $A$ in the term tree.
%For any node $m\in\NodesApp$ and index $i\geq0$ we will write $Child(m,i)$ to denote the $i$th child of $m$.
\begin{lemma}[Generalized redex argument lookup]
\label{lemma:genredex_lookup}
Let $x$ be a variable occurrence involved in a generalized redex in $gr(M)$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*), nosep]
    \item The path from the parent node of the redex argument down to $x$'s binder is of the form:
$ @_r \cdot \lambda\overline{x_r} \cdots
@_2 \cdot \lambda\overline{x_2} \cdot @_1 \cdot \lambda\overline{x}$
for $r\geq0$, where $@_r$ denotes the parent node of the redex argument, and $\lambda\overline{x}$ denotes $x$'s binder, such that $\lambda x$ is the $i$th lambda in the bulk lambdas $\lambda\overline{x}$ for $i\geq0$.

\item The argument of $x$ is precisely given by the $i_k$th child of node $@_k$ where $k$ is the smallest index verifying $i_k<|@_k|$ where: $i_1 = i$ and $i_{j+1} = i_j - |@_j| + |\lambda\overline{x_{j+1}}|$ for $j\geq 0$.

(i) By definition of generalized redexes and lambda lists (Definition~\ref{dfn:generalized_redex}), $@_r$ necessarily occurs in the path from $\lambda\overline{x}$ to the root. Further the path from $@_r$ to $\lambda\overline{x}$ is necessarily a spinal descent (\ie, it contains only lambda and application nodes, and no variable node). Indeed, if it contained a variable node $z$ then the lambda-list at the subterm rooted at $z$ would be empty, in which case no argument could possibly form a generalized redex with $\lambda x$.

(ii) We show by induction on $k$ that $x$ is the variable abstracted by the $i_k$th lambda in $\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{x_k})$, which implies the result since by definition $\lambda x$ forms a generalized redex with the $i_k$th argument of $@_k$.
Base case $k=1$. By assumption, $\lambda x$ is the $i$th lambda in the bulk lambda $\lambda\overline{x}$. Let $k\geq 1$. By the induction hypothesis $\lambda x$ is the $i_{k-1}$ lambda in $\lambda_l(\lambda\overline{x_{k-1}})$.
substitution involved iBy definition of $k$ we have $i_{k-1}\geq|@_{k-1}|$, therefore by definition of $\lambda_l$, the long-application $@_{k-1}$ has the effect of popping exactly $|@_{k-1}|$ arguments from the lambda-list, and the following abstraction $\lambda\overline{x_k}$ then adds $|\lambda\overline{x_k}|$ more lambdas in front of the lambda list. Hence $\lambda x$ gets moved to position $i_{k-1} - |@_{k-1}| + |\lambda\overline{x_k}| = i_k$ in the lambda list at $\lambda\overline{x_k}$.

\paragraph{Traversal bisimulation}

We define $\travset^\dagger(M)$ as the subset of traversals of $\travsetnorm(M)$ ending with either a structural node or an external ghost variable (\ie, not ending with an internal ghost variable nor a ghost lambda).
Observe that every traversal in $\travsetnorm$ has a traversal extension in $\travset^\dagger$.
Indeed, if $t \in \travsetnorm$ ends with an internal ghost variable or a ghost lambda then repeatedly applying
rules \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{Lmd} yields a traversal ending with an external node.

\begin{definition}[Traversal bisimulation]
\label{def:bisimilar_terms}
Let $M$ and $N$ be two terms with variables in $\mathcal{V}$. Let $\phi\colon \justseqset(N) \rightarrow\justseqset(M)$ be a function from the justified sequences of $N$ to justified sequences of $M$. We define the state transition system $(X, R_\phi, \rightarrow_X)$ as:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{States}: $X$ is the disjoint union $\travset^\dagger(M) + \travset^\dagger(N)$.

    \item \emph{Binary relation $R_\phi\subseteq X \times X$} defined for any traversals $t, u \in X$ as:
    $ t~R_\phi~u$ just if $t\in\travset^\dagger(M)$, $u\in\travset^\dagger(N)$ and $\phi(u) = t$.

    \item \emph{Transitions} For all $t, t' \in \travset^\dagger(M)$ we write $t \rightarrow_M t'$ just if $t'$ is a minimal extension of $t$ that remains in $\travset^\dagger(M)$ (\ie, $t'$ extends $t$ using rules of Table~\ref{tab:normalizing_trav_rules} and any occurrence strictly between the last occurrence in $t$ and $t'$ is an either internal ghost variable or a ghost lambda node.) We define $\rightarrow_N$  identically and write $t \rightarrow_X t'$ if either $t \rightarrow_M t'$ or $t \rightarrow_N t'$ holds for $t, t' \in X$.
\end{itemize}

$M$ and $N$ are \defname{$\phi$-bisimilar} if $R_\phi$ defines a bisimulation over $X$ with respect to $\rightarrow_X$, that is:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item (B1) for all $t_1, t_2 \in \travset^\dagger(M)$, $u_1 \in \travset^\dagger(N)$ with $t_1~R_\phi~u_1$ and $t_1 \rightarrow_M t_2$ there is $u_2 \in \travset^\dagger(N)$ such that $u_1 \rightarrow_N u_2$ and $t_2~R_\phi~u_2$.
    \item (B2) for all $t_1 \in \travset^\dagger(M)$, $u_1, u_2 \in \travset^\dagger(N)$ with $t_1~R_\phi~u_1$ and $u_1 \rightarrow_N u_2$ there is $t_2 \in \travset^\dagger(M)$ such that $t_1 \rightarrow_M t_2$ and $t_2~R_\phi~u_2$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:bisimulation_isomorphism}
If $M$ and $N$ are $\phi$-bisimilar;
the restriction of $\phi$ to $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(N))$ is injective;
and there is a mapping $\rho: \VarSet^*(N) \rightarrow \VarSet^*(M)$ such that for any variable names $\alpha\in\VarSet^*(N)$,  $\phi$ and $\coresymbol_\alpha$ commute modulo $\rho$:
(\ie, for all $u$, $ \coresymbol_{\rho(\alpha)}(\phi(u)) = \phi(\coresymbol_{\alpha}(u))$), then $\coresymbol(\travset(N)) \cong \coresymbol(\travset(M))$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider $\phi$ as a function from $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(N))$ to $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(M))$.
It is \emph{well-defined}: $\travset^\dagger(N)$ is by definition the transitive closure of the empty traversal by $\rightarrow_N$, so for any traversal $u$ of $\travset^\dagger(N)$, repeatedly applying (B2) for each step of its $\rightarrow_N$ derivation shows that $t = \phi(u) \in \travset^\dagger(M)$. By commutativity of $\coresymbol$ and $\phi$ we have $\coresymbol(t)=\phi(\coresymbol(u)) \in \coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(M))$.
Similarly, it is \emph{surjective} by (B1) because $\travset^\dagger(M)$ is the transitive closure of the empty traversal by $\rightarrow_M$. Finally it is \emph{injective} by assumption.
Hence we have $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(N)) \cong \coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(M))$, and because $\coresymbol$ eliminates internal nodes from traversals, we also have $\coresymbol(\travset(N)) \cong \coresymbol(\travset(M))$.
\end{proof}

%%%%% Soundness of leftmost liner reduction
The sets of normalizing traversals before and after linear reduction are identical, up to appropriate mapping between nodes of the term and its reduct.
\begin{proposition}[Traversals are sound for linear reduction]
\label{prop:ulctrav_impl_linear_reduction}
Let $M$ be an untyped term.
If $M \llred N$ then $\coresymbol(\travsetnorm(M)) \cong \coresymbol(\travsetnorm(N))$.
\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
\proofatend
Suppose that $M \llred N$. Let $x$ denote the leftmost linear variable occurrence in $M$ and
let $(\lambda x, A)$ be the generalized redex involving it, so that $N$ is the term obtained after
firing the generalized redex $(\lambda x, A)$. A property of linear head reduction is that the reduct contains the original
term itself, modulo alpha conversion and relabelling of the \emph{lloc} node. This induces an implicit map $\Phi$ from nodes
of the reduct $N$ to those of $M$:
$$\Phi : \ExtendedNodes(N)  \rightarrow \ExtendedNodes(M) $$
which maps nodes from the substituted subterm in $N$ to the corresponding nodes under argument $A$ in $M$;
and every node in $N$ that is not involved in the substitution, to its counterpart in $M$.

The substitution involved in the leftmost linear reduction affects the computation tree in three possible ways depending on the structure and number of $x$'s operands:
\begin{description}[itemindent=1em]
    \item[Case 1] $x$ has at least one operand ($|x|>0$) and $A$ is an abstraction;
    \item[Case 2] $x$ has at least one operand ($|x|>0$) and $A$ is not an abstraction;
    \item[Case 3] $x$ is unapplied ($|x|=0$).
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% Summary of the proof %%%%%%
% Observe first that the nodes of the subterm $A$$ map 1-1 to the nodes of
% the subterm $\phi(x)$ in $N$.
% We can therefore defined $\psi$ such that all the nodes in $t$ hereditarily justified by the root of $A$ are
% mapped by $\psi$ to the corresponding nodes in $N$. We omit the full details of the induction which is purely
% mechanical and straightforward. The idea being that $N$ is obtained by transposing the structure of the subterm
% $A$ in place of $x$ with the additional relabelling of $x$'s parent $\lambda\overline{y}$ as
%$\lambda\overline{y}\overline{z}$ where $\lambda\overline{a}$ denotes the root of $A$. The key observation
% is that this relabelling is innocuous in the sense that all rules applied to $t$ in $M$ can also be
% applied to $\psi(t)$ in $N$.
%
% It is easy to see show traversal of $M$ can be bisimulated in $N$ all the way to variable $x$.
% It's more delicate to show that further extensions can also be bisimulated, in particular traversals of
%  the subterm $R$ in $M$ can be bisimulated by traversals of $R'$ in the reduct $N$.
% We omit the tedious details here for succinctness.  The key observation is that
% because the enabling relation $\enables$ in $R$ is preserved through $\phi$ after substitution and
%  alpha-conversion in the subterm $R'$, the subsequent traversal
%  of argument $R$ in $M$ can be bisimulated by traversing $R'$ in
%   the reduct $N$ using the exact same traversal rules used to traverse $M$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We proceed by showing that for each of the three cases, there is an injection $\phi$ such that $M$ and $N$ are $\phi$-bisimilar.

\begin{description}[itemindent=0em,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item[Case 1]
    The reduction is represented on Figure~\ref{fig:firing_genredex_effect_on_tree_with_operands_and_lambda_argument}
    where $x$ has some operand ($|x|>0$), and $A$ is an abstraction $\lambda\overline{y}. R$.

    Let $\lambda\overline{x}$ denote $x$'s binding lambda node in $M$, $i$ denote $x$'s binding index, and $@_a$ denote the parent node of the subterm $A$.

    After reduction:
    (i) Node $x$ gets replaced by an application node $@_x$ and its existing children are preserved.
    (ii) The subterm $\lambda\overline{y}'. R'$, obtained from $R$ by renaming variable afresh to avoid variable capture, becomes the operator child of $@_x$.  (Note that we write $\lambda\overline{y}'$ to distinguish the root node of $R'$ from the root $\lambda\overline{y}$ of $R$ in $N$, even though the bound variable names are $\overline{y}$ for both nodes.)

    We thus have $\Phi(@_x) = x$, $\Phi(\lambda\overline{y}') = \lambda\overline{y}$, and $\Phi$ maps each node from subterm $\lambda\overline{y}'. R'$  to the corresponding node under $\lambda\overline{y}.R$.

Observe that $\Phi$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item $\Phi$ preserves the parent-child relation for lambda and variable nodes: for any lambda or variable node $n$, the child nodes of $n$'s image by $\Phi$ are the image of the $n$'s children. (This is not true for application node $@_x$, however);

    \item $\Phi$ is naming-consistent: any two variable nodes sharing the same name  in $N$ map to variable nodes with same name in $M$;

    \item $\Phi$ preserves variable binding: it maps the binder lambda node of a variable node $z$ in $N$ to the binder in $M$ of $\Phi(z)$;

    \item hence $\Phi$ preserves the enabling relation: if $n_1 \enables_i n_2$ in $N$ for $i\geq 0$, $n_1,n_2 \in \Nodes(N)$ then $\Phi(n_1) \enables_i \Phi(n_1)$ as long as $(n_1,n_2) \neq (@_x,\lambda\overline{y}')$.

    \item $\Phi$ preserves node types: images of external and internal nodes are respectively external and internal nodes; images of variable/@-nodes are variable/@-nodes; images of lambda nodes are lambda nodes; images of ghost and structural nodes are respectively ghost and structural;

    \item $\Phi$ preserves node arity. In particular $|x| = |@_x|$ since $@_x$'s operator does not contribute to its arity;

    \item $\Phi$ is not injective: since for any node in $R'$ there is a corresponding node in $R$ that is mapped to the same node in $M$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $\justseqset^P$ denote the subset $\justseqset$
consisting of justified sequences verifying the P-view-path correspondence:
the P-view at every occurrence of an internal node is precisely the path from the root to that node in the computation tree. By Property~\ref{prop:tree_path_charact} we have $\travset \subseteq \justseqset^P$.

We define $\phi$ as an extension of $\Phi$ to justified sequences of $\justseqset^P$ of $N$ as follows:
(i) maps all other occurrences to their image by $\Phi$;
(ii) it preserves all justification pointers except for $@_x$ and $\lambda\overline{y}'$;
(iii) inserts in-between each occurrence of $x$ and its immediately following lambda-node, the corresponding \emph{argument lookup} of $x$. Formally $\phi = \phi_1 \circ \phi_2$ where
\begin{align*}
\phi_1 \colon & \justseqset^P(N) \rightarrow \justseqset(M) \\
& \epsilon \mapsto \epsilon  \\
& t \cdot n \mapsto \phi(t) \ \cdot \Phi(n) &\mbox{$\Phi(n)$ has same link label and length as $n$, for $n\not\in \{ @_x, \lambda\overline{y} \}$}\\
 & t \cdot @_x \mapsto \phi(t) \ \cdot x &\mbox{$x$ points to the first occurrence of $x$'s binder in $\pview{t}$} \\
& t \cdot \lambda\overline{y}' \rightarrow \phi(t) \ \cdot \lambda\overline{y} &\mbox{$\lambda\overline{y}$ points to the last occurrence of $@_a$ in $\pview{t}$.}
\end{align*}
and $\phi_2$ is the function that inserts the argument lookup sequence of ghost nodes between each occurrence of $x$ and $\lambda\overline{y}$ in a justified sequence. Observe that the argument lookup of $x$ is entirely statically determined and thus can be reconstructed from any (visible) traversal $t_{\leq x}$ of $M$ by repeatedly instantiating rules \rulenamet{Lmd} and \rulenamet{Var} starting from $t_{\leq x}$ until reaching node $\lambda\overline{y}$.

The following example illustrates how $\phi$ is calculated on a generic
traversal $u$ of $N$ involving the lloc variable $x$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    u &=& \Pstr[10pt]{ \ldots (aa){@_a} \cdot (la){\bulklambda{\xi_a}} \cdot \ldots (a1){@_1} \cdot (l1){\bulklambda{\xi_1}} \cdot @ \ldots \bulklambda{z} \cdot (ax){@_x} \cdot (ly-ax,20:0){\bulklambda{y}'} }
    \\
    \phi_1(u) &=& \Pstr[10pt]{ \ldots (aa){@_a} \cdot (la){\bulklambda{\xi_a}} \cdot \ldots (a1){@_1} \cdot (l1){\bulklambda{\xi_1}} \cdot @ \ldots \bulklambda{z} \cdot (x-l1,30:i) x \cdot (ly-a,25){\bulklambda{y}} }
    \\
    \phi(u) = \phi_2(\phi_1(u)) &=& \Pstr[10pt]{ \ldots (aa){@_a} \cdot (la){\bulklambda{\xi_a}} \cdot \ldots (a1){@_1} \cdot (l1){\bulklambda{\xi_1}} \cdot @ \ldots \bulklambda{z} \cdot (x-l1,30:i) x \cdot \ghostlmd \cdot \ghostvar \ldots \ghostlmd \cdot \ghostvar \cdot (ly-a,20:i_a){\bulklambda{y}} }
\end{eqnarray*}

Some immediate properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\phi_1$, and $\phi$ are well defined since by the P-view-path property, $x$'s binder and (resp.~$@_a$) must necessarily occurs in the P-view at $x$ (resp.~$\lambda\overline{y}'$).

\item The restriction of $\phi$ to $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(N))$
coincides precisely with the element-wise structure-preserving\footnote{Recall that two justified sequences over two distinct terms share the same structure just if their constituting nodes are of the same kind (variable/@ nodes or lambda node), have the same link labels, and same pointer lengths.} extension of $\Phi$ over justified sequences.
This is because $\phi_1$ only alters justification pointers of internal nodes ($@_x$ and $\lambda\overline y$) and $\phi_2$ only inserts internal nodes, while justified sequences in $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(N))$ do not contain any external node.

\item The restriction of $\phi$ to $\coresymbol(\travset^\dagger(N))$, is injective.
%%%%%%% Short summary: because when a traversal extends in more than one possible way (with rule \rulenamet{IVar}), then either the next possible occurrences all have distinct justification pointers, or $\Phi$ maps them to distinct nodes in $M$.
Suppose that $\coresymbol(u)\neq\coresymbol(v)$ for $u,v\in\travset^\dagger(N)$ then we must have $u\neq v$.
Let $s$ denote the longest common prefix of $u$ and $v$; and $n_1, n_2$ the nodes immediately following $s$ in $u$ and $v$
respectively. We have $s \rightarrow_N s \cdot n_1$ and $s \rightarrow_N s\cdot n_2$ with $n_1\ne n_2$ therefore $n_1, n_2$ are necessarily traversed
by the non-deterministic rule \rulenamet{IVar}. Hence they must both be external nodes and therefore they are not eliminated after applying $\coresymbol$: the last occurrence of $\coresymbol(s\cdot n_1)$ and $\coresymbol(s\cdot n_2)$ are different. Since $\Phi$ maps distinct external sibling nodes in $N$ to distinct sibling nodes in $M$, we necessarily have
$\phi(\coresymbol(s\cdot n_1))\neq \phi(\coresymbol(s\cdot n_2))$.
%%%%%%%%%

\item $\coresymbol$ and $\phi$ commute modulo the implicit renaming function $\rho: \VarSet^*(N) \rightarrow \VarSet^*(M)$ underlying $\Phi$. Formally, for any variable names $\alpha\in\VarSet^*$ occurring in $N$ we have:
$$
\phi(\coresymbol_\alpha(u)) = \coresymbol_{\rho(\alpha)}(\phi(u)) \ .
$$
This is shown by an easy induction and by assuming, without loss of generality, that variable names are not reused in either $M$ or $N$: each variable name is introduced by at most one lambda node in each term. (This condition can always be met via alpha-conversion.)
\end{itemize}

We now show that $M$ and $N$ are in $\phi$-bisimulation by induction on the traversals rules.

\emph{Base case}: $\rulename{Root}_\normalizing$ The empty traversal in $M$ is trivially the image by $\phi$ of the empty traversal in $N$. Same for the two singleton traversals consisting of the root nodes of $M$ and $N$.

\emph{Induction}: Let $u\in \travset^\dagger(N)$, $t\in\travset^\dagger(M)$ with $t = \phi (u)$ and $m, n$ denote respectively the last node in $t$ and $u$. We prove both directions by case analysis on the \emph{first} traversal rule used to extend $t$ (resp.~$u$).

Observe that the result holds trivially up until the traversal in $M$ reaches occurrence $x$ since one can use the exact same rules used to traverse $M$ in order to traverse the corresponding node in $N$, and reciprocally for traversals of $N$ until reaching node $@_x$. The crucial part of the induction takes place when traversing the \emph{lloc} variable $x$ (or $@_x$ in $N$).

\begin{itemize}[itemindent=0.5em, leftmargin=0.5em]
    \item $\rulename{App}_\normalizing$ We have $m = \Phi(n)$.

    (B1) Suppose $t$ extends to $t'$ with the application rule then $m, n \in\NodesApp$. Then the last occurrence $m'$ in $t'$ is the unique node verifying $m \enables_0 m'$.  Since $\Phi$ does not map $@_x$ to an application node we necessarily have  $n \neq @_x$. Thus $\phi$ preserves the enabling relation at $n$, and we can use the application rule in $N$ to extend $u$ into $u' = u \cdot n'$ where $n \enables_0 n'$ and $\phi(n') = m'$.

    (B2) Suppose $u'$ extends traversal $u$ with the application rule then the last occurrence $n$ in $u$ is an application node.
    If $n\neq@_x$ then $\phi$ preserves the enabling relation at $n$ and therefore the application rule can be used in $M$ to simulate $u'$.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Case t ends with lloc variable occurrence x
    Otherwise, $n=@_x$ and since $t = \phi(u)$ we must have $m = \Phi(@_x) = x$.
    and $u' = u \cdot \lambda\overline{y}'$.
    Let $@_j$ and $\lambda\overline{\xi_j}$ for $1\leq j\leq a$, $a\geq 1$ denote respectively the application and lambda nodes in the spinal descent
    from $@_a$ to $x$'s binder. So that $\lambda\overline{\xi_1}$ is $x$'s binder, $@_1$ its parent,  and $@_a$ is $\lambda\overline{y}$'s parent.
    By Lemma~\ref{lemma:genredex_lookup}, $@_a$ is precisely the lowest application node in the spinal descent
    from $@_a$ to $\lambda\overline{\xi_1}$ verifying $|@_a| >  i_a$,
        where $i_a = i + \sum_{1\leq j< a} (|\lambda\overline{\xi_j}| - |@_j|)$.
    This formula precisely captures the ``pending argument lookup'' algorithm implicitly
    implemented by the rules \rulenamet{Lmd} and \rulenamet{Var}:
    with exactly $i_a$ instantiations of those two rules, traversal $t$ gets extended by $2(i_a-1)$ ghost nodes followed
    by the root of $A$:
            $$ t \rightarrow_M t \cdot v \cdot \lambda\overline{y}$$
    where  $v$ is a \emph{pending argument lookup}.
    Therefore by definition of $\phi$ if $v$ denote the argument lookup of $x$ we have:
    $\phi(u')
    = \phi(u \cdot \lambda\overline{y}')
    = \phi(u) \cdot \phi(\lambda\overline{y}')
    = t \cdot v \cdot \lambda\overline{y} \in \travset^\dagger(M)$.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \item $\rulename{Lam}^@_\normalizing$
    (B1) follows from the fact that parent-child relation is preserved by $\Phi$
    (B2) Suppose $n \neq \lambda\overline{z}$ then it follows again from the fact that parent-child relation is preserved by $\Phi$.
    Otherwise, we have $n = \lambda\overline{z}$ and $u \rightarrow_N u \cdot \lambda\overline{y}'$ can be simulated in $M$ using rule $\rulename{Lam}^{\sf var}$: $t \rightarrow_M t \cdot x$.

    \item $\rulename{Lam}^{\sf var}_\normalizing$
    We have already shown that  $\phi$ preserves the local child-parent relationship for lambda nodes; node types, and arity of lambda nodes.
    It remains to show that any $\enables$-enabler of $m$ that is visible at  $u$ is mapped to an enabler of $n$ that is visible in $\phi(u)$.

    Since the last node of $t$ and $u$ are structural lambda nodes, their P-view do not contain any ghost node nodes, and in particular the argument lookups inserted by $\phi_2$ are not involved in the P-view calculation. Hence $\pview{\phi(u)} = \pview{\phi_1(u)}$.
    But by the P-view path characterization of traversals $\pview{\phi_1(u)}$ is precisely the path in $M$ from $\Phi(n)$ to the root of $M$,
    and $\pview{u}$ is the path in $N$ from $n$ to the root of $N$.

    If $n$ is not under $\lambda\overline{y}'.R'$ then the path to the root is not impacted by the reduction and therefore the path in $M$ and $N$ are identical modulo $\phi$: we thus have $\pview{\phi_1(u)} = \phi_1(\pview{u})$.
    Otherwise if $n$ is under $\lambda\overline{y}'.R'$ then the path from $m$ to the root in $M$ is precisely the element-wise image by $\Phi$ of the path from $n$ to the root in $N$ with the exclusion of the spinal descent from $@_a$ to $@_x$. But by construction of $N$, none of the variable in $R'$ are bound by the lambda nodes in the spinal descent.

    Hence, the rule $\rulename{Lam}^{\sf var}_\normalizing$ used to extend  $u$ can also be used to extend $t$, and reciprocally.

    \item $\rulename{Lam^\ghostvar_\normalizing}$
    This case is excluded since $t$ and $u$ belong to $\travset^\dagger(M)$ and
    $\travset^\dagger(N)$ respectively and therefore their last occurrence cannot be a ghost lambda.

    \item $\rulename{Var_\normalizing}$
    (B2) Since $\Phi$ maps external variable nodes to external variable nodes,preserves the parent-child relation for variable nodes and $\phi$ preserves the justification pointer of external variable nodes, if this rule can extend traversal $u$ with node $n'$ then the same rule can be used to extend $t$ with $\phi(n')$.

    (B1) Suppose that $t$ ends with \emph{lloc} variable $x$ in which case $t' = t \cdot \lambda\overline{y}$, then
        we can just take $u = u' \cdot @_x$ and conclude exactly like we did for case $\rulename{App}_\normalizing$ (B2).
    Otherwise, if $m\neq x$, we conclude like in case (B1).

    \item $\rulename{IVar_\normalizing}$ $\Phi$ preserves node types, arity of variable nodes. It remains to show that it preserves \emph{arity threshold} of traversals: In an argument lookup, all occurrences are ghost with arity $0$ therefore they do not affect the arity threshold calculation. Hence $\arth(\phi(u))=\arth(\phi_1(u))$. Further $\Phi$ preserves arity and maps external and internal nodes to external and internal nodes respectively, thus $\arth(\phi_1(u))=\phi_1(\arth(u))$.
    Hence the rule $\rulename{Var_\normalizing}$ used to extend $u$ can be used to extend $t$, and reciprocally.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%% CASE 2
\item[Case 2] where $x$ has at least one operand ($|x|>0$) and $A$ is an application ($|\overline{y}|=0$). The root lambda node of $A$ is therefore a dummy lambda: $A = \lambda. R$. Let $r$ denote the root node of $R$, which is either a variable if $R$ is in head-normal form, or an $@$-node otherwise.
The tree of the reduct $N$ is obtained from $\ctree(M)$
by substituting $x$'s label with that of $r$ (modulo variable renaming to avoid capture if $r$ is a variable node) and prepending $r$'s children to existing $x$'s children. Other nodes, including $x$'s parent lambda node, remain untouched. Let $r'$ denote this updated node in the reduct $N$.
This transformation yields an implicit mapping function $\Phi : \ExtendedNodes(N)\rightarrow \ExtendedNodes(N)$ such that $\Phi(r') = x$.
Although $\Phi$ does not preserve the arity of $x$, it does not affect the arity threshold of traversals since $|r'| = |x| + |r|$.
We can then extend $\Phi$ to a function $\phi$ on justified sequence and show by induction that it yields a bisimulation similarly to the previous case.

%%%%%%% CASE 3
\item[Case 3] where $x$ is unapplied ($|x|=0$).
After reduction, node $x$ gets replaced by subterm $A$ and the label of $x$'s parent lambda node gets concatenated with the label of $A$'s root node:
the parent lambda node $\lambda\overline{z}$ of $x$ in $M$ becomes $\lambda\overline{z}\overline{y}'$ in the reduct $N$.
Like in the first case, we can define a function $\phi$ such that
 traversals of $M$ of the form $\ldots \lambda\overline{z}\cdot x \cdot v \cdot \lambda\overline{y} \cdot \ldots$, where $v$ is an argument lookup, are images of traversals in $N$ of the form $\ldots \cdot \lambda\overline{z}\overline{y}' \ldots$. Once again, although the arity of $x$ is not preserved, this does not affect the arity threshold because $|\lambda{\overline{z} \overline{y}'}| =
 |\lambda{\overline{z}}| +  |\lambda{\overline{y}}|$.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% End of case where t ends with lloc variable occurrence x

Hence $M$ and $N$ are in $\phi$-bisimulation, thus because $\phi$ is injective and commutes with $\coresymbol$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:bisimulation_isomorphism} the two sets of traversals are isomorphic.

    Let $M$ be an untyped term containing only trivial redexes, and $N$ the reduct obtained by firing the \emph{leftmost spinal-innermost} trivial redex, then $\coresymbol(\travsetnorm(M)) \cong \coresymbol(\travsetnorm(N))$.

Let's consider the tree structure at the trivial redex on Figure~\ref{fig:reducing_trivialredex}. It is of the form $(\lambda \overline{x} . T) A_1 \ldots A_r$ for $r\geq1$ where $(x_1, A_1)$ forms the leftmost trivial redex.

\label{fig:reducing_trivialredex}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{description}
    \item[Case $r>1$] Because the structure of the tree is preserved after reduction, there is an implicit injection $\Phi$ from nodes of the reduct $N$ to nodes of $M$. Let $\phi$ denote its element-wise structure-reserving  extension to justified sequences.

    Firstly, $M$ and $N$ are in $\phi$-bisimulation. We omit the details, the key observations are:
    (i) Since $x_1$ does not occur in $T$, the term $A_1$ will never be traversed in $N$.
    (ii) Only nodes hereditarily justified by $\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n$ see their label (or link label) changed after applying $\Phi$. But since those are external nodes, they get filtered out by the core projection $\coresymbol$.
    (iii) The arity of node $\lambda x_2 \ldots x_n$ increases by $1$ after applying $\Phi$, but it does not impact the arity threshold of traversals because the arity of the application node also increases by $1$.

    Secondly, since $\Phi$ is injective, so is its element-wise extension to justified sequences.

    Finally, $\phi$ and $\coresymbol$ commute. This is shown by an easy induction, observing that nodes $@$ and $\lambda x_2\ldots x_n$ necessarily occur consecutively in a traversal of $N$, and because $|@| = |\Phi(@)| -1$ and $|\lambda x_2\ldots x_n| = |\Phi(\lambda x_2\ldots x_n)| - 1$, the core projection is preserved modulo $\Phi$.

    Hence by Lemma~\ref{lem:bisimulation_isomorphism} the two sets of traversals are isomorphic.

    \item[Case $r=1$] Depicted on Figure~\ref{fig:reducing_trivialredex} (bottom). The tree structure is altered: the application node and the argument $A_1$ are eliminated in the reduct. There is an implicit injection $\Phi$ from nodes of $N$ to nodes of $M$. We extent this function to \emph{occurrences} of nodes as follows. Let's introduce the abbreviation $\overline{y} = \overline\eta x_2 \ldots x_n$.
    \begin{align*}
        \Phi\colon O_4(N) &\rightarrow O_4(M) \\
        (n,p,d,k) &\longmapsto (\Phi(n),p,d,k) & \mbox{if $n\neq\lambda\overline{y}$} \\
        (\lambda\overline{y},p,d,k) &\longmapsto (\lambda\overline\eta,(x_2 \ldots x_n \cdot p),d,k)
    \end{align*}
    So in particular, $\Phi$ maps occurrences of $\lambda\overline{y}$ to occurrences of $\lambda\overline\eta$ with binding variables $x_2 \ldots x_n$ appended to $\overline\eta$.
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi(\lambda\overline{y})
        =
        \lambda\overline\eta^{[x_2\ldots x_n]}
        \label{eqn:phi_maps_lambday_to_lambdaeta}
    \end{equation}
    Observe also that $\Phi$ commutes with the rebinding operation: because in the case of $\lambda\overline{y}$, $\Phi$ appends variable names to the left whereas the rebinding operation appends variables names to the right.

    We extend $\Phi$ to justified sequences by taking the element-wise extension $\phi$ with the following additional modification: any occurrence of node $\lambda\overline{y}$ in a traversal of $N$ gets expanded by $\phi$ into the three occurrences $\lambda\overline\eta \cdot @ \cdot \lambda\overline{x}$ in $M$.

    We have the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi$ is injective. It follows from the fact that $\Phi$ is itself injective.

    \item $\phi$ and $\coresymbol$ commute. This is because $\phi$ carries over the list of pending lambdas and the core symbol operation adequately implements merging of nodes $\lambda\overline\eta$ and
    $\lambda\overline x_1 \ldots x_n$ into
    $\lambda\overline\eta x_2 \ldots x_n$. Formally:

    Let $u$ be a traversal of $\travset^\dagger(N)$
    ending with $\lambda\overline{y}$ that is
    $u = u_1 \cdot \lambda\overline{y} $ for some traversal $u_1$.
    The sequence $\phi(u)$ is of the form
    $\phi(u) = \phi(u_1) \cdot \lambda\overline{\eta} \cdot @ \cdot \lambda\overline{x}$. Let $\overline\alpha$ be the list of pending lambdas at $u_{\leq \lambda\overline{y}}$. There are two cases:

    Suppose $\lambda\overline\eta$ is internal. We have:
    \begin{align*}
        \coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(\phi(u))
        &=  \coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(\phi(u_1) \cdot \lambda\overline{\eta} \cdot @ \cdot \lambda\overline{x})
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\phi(u)$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\overline{x}\overline\alpha}(\phi(u_1) \cdot
        \lambda\overline\eta \cdot @)
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{pop_1(\overline{x}\overline\alpha)}(\phi(u_1) \cdot
        \lambda\overline{\eta})
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$ and $|@|=1$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\overline\eta \cdot pop_1(\overline{x}\overline\alpha)}(\phi(u_1))
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\overline{y}\overline\alpha}(\phi(u_1))
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\overline{y}$)}
        \\
        &=  \phi(\coresymbol_{\overline{y}\overline\alpha}(u_1))
            & \mbox{(by induction hypothesis)}
        \\
        &= \phi(\coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(u_1 \cdot \lambda\overline{y})) & \mbox{(def of $\coresymbol$)} \\
        &=  \phi(\coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(u))
            & \mbox{(def.~of $u$).}
    \end{align*}

    Suppose $\lambda\overline\eta$ is external. We have:
    \begin{align*}
        \coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(\phi(u))
        &=  \coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(\phi(u_1) \cdot \lambda\overline{\eta} \cdot @ \cdot \lambda\overline{x})
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\phi(u)$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\overline{x}\overline\alpha}(\phi(u_1) \cdot
        \lambda\overline\eta \cdot @)
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{pop_1(\overline{x}\overline\alpha)}(\phi(u_1) \cdot \lambda\overline\eta)
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$ and $|@|=1$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{x_2\ldots x_n \overline\alpha}(\phi(u_1) \cdot \lambda\overline\eta)
        & \mbox{(def.~of $pop$)}
        \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\epsilon}(\phi(u_1)) \cdot \lambda\overline\eta^{[x_2\ldots x_n \overline\alpha]}
            & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$)}
    \end{align*}
    And:
    \begin{align*}
        \phi(\coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(u))
        &= \phi(\coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(u_1 \cdot \lambda\overline{y}))
        & \mbox{(def.~of $u$)}
    \\
        &= \phi(\coresymbol_{\epsilon}(u_1) \cdot \lambda\overline{y}^{[\overline\alpha]})
        & \mbox{(def.~of $\coresymbol$)}
    \\
        &= \phi(\coresymbol_{\epsilon}(u_1)) \cdot \phi(\lambda\overline{y}^{[\overline\alpha]})
        & \mbox{(def.~of $\phi$)}
    \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\epsilon}(\phi(u_1)) \cdot \phi(\lambda\overline{y}^{[\overline\alpha]})
        & \mbox{(commutativity, by I.H.)}
    \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\epsilon}(\phi(u_1)) \cdot \phi(\lambda\overline{y})^{[\overline\alpha]}
        & \mbox{($\phi$ commutes with rebinding)}
    \\
    &=  \coresymbol_{\epsilon}(\phi(u_1)) \cdot (\lambda\overline\eta^{[x_2\ldots x_n]})^{[\overline\alpha]}
        & \mbox{(by Eqn.~\ref{eqn:phi_maps_lambday_to_lambdaeta})}
    \\
        &=  \coresymbol_{\epsilon}(\phi(u_1)) \cdot\lambda\overline\eta^{[x_2\ldots x_n \overline\alpha]}
        & \mbox{(rebinding composition)}
    \end{align*}
    Hence $\phi(\coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(u)) = \coresymbol_{\overline\alpha}(\phi(u))$.

    \item $\rightarrow_M$ can simulate $\rightarrow_N$ and reciprocally. This is shown by induction on the traversal rules. One interesting case is when ghost nodes in $M$ get materialized into structural nodes in $N$:
    Consider the traversal of $M$ for some $i\geq1$:
    $t = \Pstr[10pt]{
        (l){\lambda\overline\eta} \cdot (a)@ \cdot (lx-a,25:0){\lambda\overline{x}} \cdot \ldots \cdot (gl-a,30:i)\ghostlmd \cdot (gv-l,32:{|\eta|-1+i})\ghostvar }
    $.
    If $i>n$ then corresponding traversal in $N$
    also ends with a ghost variable:
    $u = \Pstr[10pt]{
        (l){\lambda\overline\eta x_2 \ldots x_n} \cdot \ldots \cdot  (gv-l,32:{|\eta|-1+i})\ghostvar }
    $
    If $i\leq n$ then the ghost nodes $\ghostvar$ gets materialized into variable occurrence $x_i$ in $N$:
    $u = \Pstr[10pt]{
        (l){\lambda\overline\eta x_2\cdots x_n} \cdot \ldots \cdot  (gv-l,32:{|\eta|+i-1}){x_i} }
    $
    \end{itemize}
    We can then conclude by Lemma~\ref{lem:bisimulation_isomorphism} that the two sets of traversals are isomorphic.
    \end{description}
%\end{proof}
\endproofatend

\begin{example}
    The term
    $M = \lambda x. (\lambda y z.z) u$ from Example~\ref{examp:ghost_materialization} trivially reduces to $N = \lambda x z . z$. Take the traversal $t$ from Example~\ref{examp:ghost_materialization}, then we have $\coresymbol(t) = \Pstr[10pt]{ (l){\lambda x z} \cdot (gv-l,32:2)\ghostvar }$ which is equivalent to
$\Pstr[10pt]{(l){\lambda x^{[z]}} \cdot (gv-l,32:2)\ghostvar }$, itself equivalent to traversal $\Pstr[10pt]{ (l){\lambda x^{[z]}} \cdot (gv-l,32:2){z} }$ in $N$.
\end{example}


\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:qnf_and_nf_traveset_invariant}
If $M$ is in \emph{qnf} and has beta-normal form $N$ then $\coresymbol(\travsetnorm(M)) \cong \coresymbol(\travsetnorm(N))$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_nf}(ii) a \emph{qnf} trivially reduces to its beta-nf: there is a reduction sequence $M = M_1 \rightarrow_\beta M_2 \ldots \rightarrow_\beta M_q= N$, $q\geq1$  where in each reduction step, $M_{i+1}$ is obtained by reducing the leftmost spinal-innermost standard redex of $M_i$ (of the form $(\lambda x . U) T$ such that $U$ does not contain any redex). By Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_nf}(i), each such redex is trivial. We conclude with Proposition~\ref{prop:ulctrav_sound_for_trivialreduction} which shows that the set $\core{\travsetnorm(\_)}$ is an invariant (up to isomorphism) throughout this trivial reduction sequence.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:ulc_travnorm_finite}
Let $M$ be an untyped term with a beta-normal form. Then
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
\item All traversals in $\travsetnorm(M)$ are finite;
\item The set $\travsetnorm(M)$ is finite.
\end{enumerate*}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
(i) If $M$ has a normal form then by Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred} its linear reduction sequence yields a quasi-normal form $Q$ which by Theorem~\ref{thm:soundness_leftmostlinearred} is beta-equivalent to $M$. Thus by Proposition~\ref{prop:ulctrav_impl_linear_reduction} the traversals of $M$ and $Q$ are isomorphic. So if $M$ has an infinite traversal then so does $Q$, which contradicts Proposition~\ref{prop:qnf_traversals_are_finite}.
(ii) Traversals rules defining $\travsetnorm$ all have bounded non-determinism therefore by (i) $\travsetnorm$ is finite.
\end{proof}
%%%% REMARK: (i) It would be possible to prove (i) directly without appealing to Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred}. (In which case this theorem  would follow from the above proposition). The proof would follow a similar argument as that of Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred}, by showing that traversals lead to the head variable in the beta-nf, and recursively to head variables of its arguments. So an i traversals would yield (through P-view) to an infinite sequence of paths in the beta-normal form, which is a contradiction since beta-nf have a finite tree representation.

%%%% REMARK: If we did not make use of Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred} to prove the above, the above would imply  Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred}.
% Sketch: suppose M has beta-nf and that its leftmost linear reduction does not terminate, then
% => there is an infinite sequence of linear reducts.
% => dept of reducts is unbound
% => The depth of the lloc in this sequence of reducts gets deeper and deeper
% => Because traversals are sound for linear reduction (Proposition \ref{prop:ulctrav_impl_linear_reduction}, all the reducts are beta-equivalent
% => there exists an infinite traversal in Trav_Norm(M)
% => contradicts that M is a beta-nf by Prop~\ref{prop:ulc_travnorm_finite}.

\begin{proposition}
Algorithm~\ref{algo:ulc_normalization_by_traversals} terminates.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition~\ref{prop:ulc_travnorm_finite} there is a finite number of traversals in $\travsetnorm$ and each of them can be obtained with finitely many applications of traversal rules.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[ULC Normalized Paths Characterization]
\label{thm:path_charact_ulc}
Let $M$ be an untyped term with normal form $T$.
$$\travsetnorm(M)/{\sim} \ \cong\ \pathset(T) \ .$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let's first assume that $M$ is in beta-normal form. Then its computation tree does not contain any $@$-node and all nodes must be external.
Hence the arity threshold of a traversal ending with external variable $x$ is precisely $|x|$, the arity of $x$. A straightforward induction on the traversal
rules shows, that since the \rulenamet{Var} is never used, we necessarily have  $\travsetnorm(M) = \pathset(M)$. Further, since all nodes are externals, the projection $\coresymbol$ and $\pview{\_}$ functions both coincides with the identity function thus $\pview{\core{\travsetnorm(M)}} = \travsetnorm(M) = \pathset(M)$.

Otherwise, since $M$ has a beta-nf, by Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness_leftmostlinearred} its \emph{leftmost linear reduction sequence} terminates and yields a \emph{qnf}. By Proposition~\ref{prop:ulctrav_impl_linear_reduction} the set of traversals is preserved by \emph{linear reduction} (up to an isomorphism) thus the set of traversals of the \emph{qnf} is isomorphic to the set of traversals of $M$. Corollary~\ref{cor:qnf_and_nf_traveset_invariant} permits us to conclude.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Soundness of the normalization procedure} It follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:path_charact_ulc} and the fact that a term is uniquely characterized by its set of justified paths $\pathset$ (Property~\ref{prop:tree_path_charact}).

% \begin{remark}
% The infinitary counterpart of the characterization theorem for lambda terms with no normal form (not shown in this paper) can be stated as:
% $$ \Union_{k\geq0} \left(\travulc^k(M)/{\sim}\right) = \pathset(BT(M))$$
% where $\travulc^k(M)$ denotes the set of traversals of length $k$ at most and $\pathset(BT(M))$ denotes the set of \emph{possibly infinite} maximal paths in the B\"oem tree $BT(M)$ of $M$ (the infinitary computation tree of the term obtained by reducing beta-redexes ad-infinitum~\cite{barendregt2013lambda}).\footnote{See also~\cite{Blum17-HomogNotRestriction, OngLics2006} for a formal definition of infinitary computation trees.}

\section{Further directions}

As we have seen, the traversal theory of the untyped lambda calculus implements leftmost linear reduction, a non-strict (``hyper-lazy''~\cite{danosherbelinregnier1996}) reduction strategy that substitutes variables one at a time. This bring the question of whether alternative notions of traversals are definable by considering other evaluation strategies such as call-by-name and call-by-value~\cite{plotkin-75}. A call-by-name version of head-linear reduction, that does not reduce inside the body of an unapplied abstraction, would easily be accommodated in the traversal setting. A strict evaluation strategy like call-by-value, on the other hand, might require substantial changes. As for traditional reduction strategies, such as the normal order of lambda calculus, it is not immediately obvious how to implement simultaneous substitution with traversals since, by nature, they traverse the term tree one node at a time. Perhaps this can be modeled by non-deterministically spawning new traversals for every free occurrence of the variable to be substituted.


\begin{todobox}
- Optimality in L\'evy's sense: how to interpret in traversal world?
Traversals exhibit some sharing via their use of pointers, but this sharing is not exploited: in the term $(\lambda x. y x x) A$, both occurrences of variable $x$ get traversed by jumping to the argument $A$, the second occurrences lead to the same traversal unfolding without utilizing the result from the first occurrence of $x$.

--- Optimality: hyperlazy does npt mean efficient: linear substitution ends up repeating same things several times. However, no useless work is done, unlike the traditional subsistution. Could we recover optimality by adding some notion of cachine to traversals?

It would perhaps require some additional caching mechanism to be able to reuse previous sections of traversals when traversing new occurrences of variables

\end{todobox}


We conjecture that a Game Semantics correspondence similar
to Theorem~\ref{thm:gamesem_correspondence_stlc} holds for
the untyped lambda calculus: that there is an isomorphism between the cores of imaginary traversals from Table~\ref{tab:trav_rules} and the innocent \emph{effectively almost everywhere copycat (EAC)} game denotation of untyped lambda terms~\cite{KerThesis}; as well as an isomorphism between the imaginary traversals and the EAC game denotation where internal moves are not hidden during strategy composition. We suspect that a connection exists between the `on-the-fly' eta-expansion performed by imaginary traversals and the morphism $Fun : U \rightarrow (U \Rightarrow U)$ of Ker's game category, where $U$ denotes the maximal game arena of the EAC strategies.

- Thank reviewer
- Where proofs are not given:
    - either leave out completely
    - or better  write a sentence to give the proof method.
    - some of the proofs from the appendix could have been brought into
    the paper by showing just some interesting/non-standard cases.

% \subsection*{Higher-order collapsible pushdown automata}

% In the typed-setting, there are well-understood correspondences between grammars and automaton. When used as tree-generating devices, for instances, higher-order recursion schemes can be turned into equivalent \emh{collapsible} higher-order pushdown automata, and reciprocally~\cite{OngLics2006}. A recursion scheme can be viewed as a closed typed lambda-term with recursion of ground type with order-$1$ free constructors representing the nodes and leaves of the tree (itself of ground type). The automaton resulting from the first construction proceeds by simulating traversals over the tree representation of the recursion scheme.

% What would be the untyped counterpart of such transformation? What type of automaton can simulate the imaginary traversals?
% Very likely just a turing machine!

%  The generated tree would be an order-$0$ tree representation of the beta-normal of a term: each terminal symbol of the automaton would correspond to a ``token'' of the lambda term: either a lambda node (represented by non-terminal of type $o\rightarrow o$), or a variable node (represented by a non-terminal of type $o^k\rightarrow o$ where $k\geq0$ is the number of operands applied to the variable in the beta normal form of the term.
