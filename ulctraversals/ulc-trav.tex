\title{Paranormal Traversals for the Lambda Calculus :-) [Draft] \\
 {\small Traversing and normalizing untyped lambda terms via
 head-linear reduction and on-the-fly eta-expansion.}}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This note introduces a new method to traverse untyped lambda terms. It extends the notion of traversals introduced in my thesis \cite{BlumPhd} for the simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC) to the untyped lambda calculus (ULC), and yields a method to normalize terms.

The concept of traversals was first introduced in \cite{Ong2006} to study higher-order recursion schemes used as generator of order-$0$ structures such as trees. In \cite{BlumPhd}, I extended the notion to the simply-typed lambda calculus by adding the (IVar) rule to account for free variables, and gave a concrete proof that traversals are isomoprhic to the game denotation of a simply-typed term through the `core projection' operation.

The adaptation to the untyped setting adds several new ingredients:
\begin{compactitem}
\item  The (Lam) and (Var) rules are augmented to implement eta-expansion. \item The eta-expansion is performed `on-the-fly`, as needed, at each point where the traditional STLC traversal would normally get stuck: whenever there is insufficiently many operands in an application to continue traversing the term.
\item The concept of ``ghost'' nodes is introduced. Ghost nodes are imaginary nodes in the computation tree that progressively appear as eta-expansions are performed on the subterms.
\item The computation tree itself does not get modified during eta-expansion. Ghost nodes are only added to the traversal and are only ``visible'' in the context where they get introduced.
\item The (IVar) rule, introduced in my thesis to model free variables, is constrained by a quantity called the `arity threshold` which can be calculated in linear time from the traversal itself. This limits the non-deterministic branching factor of this rule, which is required to guarantee that the normalization procedure terminates when the beta-normal form exists.
\end{compactitem}

Another notable change, compared to the original setting of traversals for recursion scheme \cite{Ong2006} or in the simply-typed lambda calculus setting \cite{BlumPhd}, is the absence of $\eta$-long transform of the term. This has the benefit to simplify the presentation: the computation tree is just a tree representation of the original, unmodified, lambda term.

I've implemented the normalization algorithm in the HOG tool. I provide some examples of normalized terms in the last section.

{\bf TODO:}

(i) Adapt the proof of the game semantics correspondence theorem from my thesis to this setting, perhaps using Andrew Ker's game model of ULC.

(ii) Establish connection with previous work by Daniil Berezun and Neil Jones on traversals compilation for ULC \cite{JonesBerezunLLL}.

(iii) Establish connection with Pointer Abstract Machines by Danos and Reigner \cite{KerThesis}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background}

In \cite{BlumPhd} we establish the correspondence between the theory of traversals and Game semantics for the simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC). The proof in the thesis relies on several ingredients:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The introduction of a new traversal rule \rulenamet{IVar} to model free variables;
  \item A formal definition of the notion of \defname{interaction game semantics} corresponding to the game denotation of a term in the usual sense but where internal moves are all revealed instead of hidden;
  \item The definition of various operations on traversals, in particular the notion of \defname{traversal core} which preserves only the ``essence'' of a traversal.
\end{enumerate}


One can then show that, for every simply-typed term $\Gamma \entail M :T$,
there is a bijection $\varphi_M$ from the set of traversals of $M$ to the revealed interaction game denotation of $M$, further there is a bijection between the standard game denotation of $M$ and its standard innocent game denotation. Formally:
\begin{theorem}[STLC Game Semantics and Traversals (Theorem 4.96 in \cite{BlumPhd}]
\label{thm:correspondence}
For every simply-typed term $\Gamma \entail M :T$ there exist two bijections
$\phi_M$ and $\psi_M$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \varphi_M  &:& \travset(\Gamma \entail M : T)^\star \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \syntrevsem{\Gamma \entail M :T} \\
 \psi_M  &:& \travset(\Gamma \entail M : T)^{\filter \theroot} \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \sem{\Gamma \entail M :T} \enspace .
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\syntrevsem{\Gamma \entail M : T}$ denotes the interaction game denotation of $M$, $\sem{\Gamma \entail M : T}$ denotes the innocent game denotation of $M$,
$\travset(M)^\star$ denotes the set of traversals where application nodes are removed, and $\travset(M)^{\filter
\theroot}$ denotes the set of traversal cores of $M$ (\ie, traversal projected to the root of the tree).
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Normalizing terms with traversals}

The \defname{projection with respect to the root} of a traversal $t$, noted $t\filter {\theroot}$, gives what we call the \defname{core} of the traversal consisting of the subsequence of nodes that are hereditarily justified by the root. By the correspondence theorem the traversal cores are precisely plays from the game denotation of the term.
Because the traversals P-views (noted $\pview{t}$ for every traversal $t$) correspond to paths in the tree representation of the term (\cite{BlumPhd}, Proposition 4.29), this yields a method to calculate the beta-normal form of any STLC term $M$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enumerate traversals of $M$;
  \item For each traversal $t$, calculate its traversal core $t \filter \theroot$. This gives a play in $\sem{M}$;
  \item Calculate the P-view of the traversal core: $\pview{t\filter \theroot}$;
  \item Apply the Correspondence bijection to get the corresponding path in the tree representation of the $\beta$-nf of $M$.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{remark}
All the traversal rules are deterministic except \rulenamet{IVar}. The rule \rulenamet{IVar} gives two non-deterministic choices: (i) the variable to pick in the O-view,
(ii) the child lambda node to pick amongst the picked variable's children.
A consequence of this definition is that even for terms having a normal form (and in particular even for beta-normal terms), the set of traversals can be infinite, and traversals can be infinitely long.
E.g. Take the term $\lambda f . f (\lambda x. x)$. We have that $\lambda f \cdot f \cdot (\lambda x \cdot  x)^k$ is a traversal for all $k\geq0$. Viewed from a game semantic perspective, those traversals accounts for all the possible denotations of the function parameter $f$: observe that for each $k$, there exists a term that applies its argument $k$ times: $\lambda y . y (y ( \ldots y)) $.

\todo{Type my handwritten notes with proof explaining this in more details.}
For the sake of computing the beta-normal form of a term, however, it's only necessary to traverse finitely many finite traversals (provided that the normal form exists). Effectively, this means limiting the rule \rulenamet{IVar} so that it traverses only nodes leading to paths in the computation tree that are yet unexplored. In practice, it means that when choosing the next lambda node to visit, one can ignore nodes that are already present in the O-view.
\end{remark}

\textbf{Implementation}
This normalization algorithm was implemented in the HOG tool mentioned in my thesis which lets you ``play the traversal game'' and calculate various types of projections including the one giving the traversal cores.

\todo{Cite Neil's paper and discussion.}
The question addressed in the present note is: can this method be extended to the untyped lambda calculus (ULC) following the same game-semantic argument but based on Ker's game model of the untyped lambda calculus instead of the game model of STLC?


\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Untyped lambda calculus}

We consider the set of terms $\Lambda$ of the untyped lambda calculus constructed from the following grammar:
$$\Lambda := x\ |\ (\Lambda\ \Lambda)\ |\ \lambda x. \Lambda $$
where $x$ ranges over a countable set of variable names.

For conciseness when writing lambda terms, we will abbreviate ``consecutive'' lambda abstraction $\lambda x_1 \ldots \lambda x_n . U$ for some $n\geq 0$ and term $U$ as just
$\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n . U$. If $\overline{x}$ denote the list of variables $x_1 \ldots x_n$ we will just write $\lambda \overline{x} . U$.

\subsection{Computation tree, enabling relation, justified sequences}

Given an untyped lambda term $M$ we define its \defname{computation tree} as the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the lambda term where consecutive lambda abstractions are merged into a single node labelled by the list of bound variables and with a single child, and similarly consecutive applications are represented by a single node labelled $@$ with multiple children: one for the operator and one for each application operand. Formally:
\begin{definition}[Computation tree of an untyped term]
	Let $M$ be an untyped lambda term with variable names in $\mathcal{V}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item
	The \defname{computation tree} $\tau(M)$ is a labelled tree with labels taken from $ \{ @ \} \union \mathcal{V} \union \{ \lambda x_1 \ldots x_n \ | \ x_1 ,\ldots, x_n \in
	\mathcal{V}, n\in\nat \}$, defined inductively on the syntax of $M$:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\tau(\lambda \overline{x} . z s_1 \ldots s_m) &=& \lambda \overline{x}\; \langle\; \underline z\; \langle\tau(s_1),\ldots,\tau(s_m)\rangle\rangle\\
		&& \hbox {where $m\geq 0$, $z \in \mathcal{V}$}, \\
 \tau(\lambda \overline{x} . (\lambda y.t) s_1 \ldots s_m) &=& \lambda \overline{x}\; \langle\; @ \; \langle \tau(\lambda y.t),\tau(s_1),\ldots,\tau(s_m) \rangle \rangle \enspace\\
&&  \hbox{where $m\geq 1$, $y\in \mathcal{V}$}.
	\end{eqnarray*}
where the expression `$l\langle t_1, \ldots, t_m \rangle$' for $m \geq 0$ denotes a labelled tree with root labelled $l$ and $m$ ordered children trees $t_1$, \ldots, $t_m$. The underlined label $z$ represents a node label for $m>0$, and a leaf label if $m=0$.

\item We write $\Nodes$ to denote the set of nodes of the computation tree. We write $\NodesVar$ for the set of variable nodes, $\NodesLmd$ for lambda nodes, and $\Nodes_{@}$ for  application nodes.
We write $\theroot$ to denote the root of the tree.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Note that any lambda term can indeed be written in one of the two forms above. In particular, applicative terms are handled by the case $n=0$ of the form $\lambda . N$ for some term $N$ where `$\lambda.$' is referred to as a ``dummy lambda''. This compact representation turns out to be useful to maintain alternation between lambda nodes (at odd level, counting from 1 onwards) and variable nodes (at even level).

Observe that the definition is similar to that of STLC \cite{Ong2006, BlumPhd} with the notable difference that the term does not get eta-long expanded prior to constructing the computation tree.

We define the \defname{enabling relation} $\enables$ between nodes of the computation tree as the relation associating each lambda node to all the variable nodes that it binds, the root of the tree to all the free variable nodes, and every variable and application node to each of their child node. We write $m \enables_k \alpha$ to indicate that a lambda node $\alpha$ is the $k$th child of a variable or application node $m$ for some $k\geq0$; and $\alpha \enables_k m$ to indicate that the node $m$ is labelled by the $k$th variable bound by $\alpha$ for $k\geq1$.

We define \defname{hereditarily enabling} as the transitive closure of the enabling relation, and we say that node $m$ \defname{hereditarily enables} node $n$ if $m \enables^* n$ where $\enables^*$ denotes the transitive closure of $\enables$. We write $\NodeHjByRoot$ to denote the set of nodes hereditarily enabled by the root, that is the image of the tree root by the transitive closure of the enabling relation.

A consequence of the definition of the enabling relation is that every node of the tree is either hereditarily justified by the root or by some application node $@$.  Variable nodes that are hereditarily enabled by the root are called \defname{external variable nodes}, and variables hereditarily justified by an application node are called \defname{internal variable nodes}.

We defined the \defname{arity} of a node as follows: the arity of a lambda node $\lambda x_1 \cdots x_k$ for $k\geq 0$ is denoted by $|\lambda x_1 \cdots x_k|$ and is defined as $k$; the arity of a variable node $x$, denoted $|x|$ is the number of children of $x$ in the computation tree; the arity of a $@$ node is the number of its children nodes minus 1 (\ie, the number of operands in the application).

\subsubsection{ULC ghost nodes}
For ULC, we extend the definition of nodes from STLC by introducing two infinite classes of ``imaginary'' nodes called \defname{ghost nodes}:
one class of ``ghost variable nodes'', denoted $\ghostvar$, and one class of ``ghost lambda nodes'', denoted $\ghostlmd$. By abuse of notation we will use $\ghostvar$ and $\ghostlmd$ to refer to particular elements of the two respective classes.

We refer to nodes $\Nodes$ of the computation tree as \defname{structural nodes}, and nodes in $\ghostlmd$ and $\ghostvar$ as the \defname{ghost nodes}. We will write $\NodesLmd^\ghostlmd$ as a shortand for $\NodesLmd + \ghostlmd$
and $\NodesVar^\ghostvar$ as a shortand for $\NodesVar + \ghostvar$.

We extend the definition of the enabling relation $\enables$ to ghost nodes by induction as follows: for every (ghost) variable or application node $m$ and for all $k>|m|$ there is a ghost lambda node $\ghostlmd$ such that $m \enables_k \ghostlmd$; for all (ghost) lambda node $\alpha$ and all $k>|\alpha|$ there is a ghost variable node $\ghostvar$ such that $\alpha \enables_k \ghostvar$.

Observe that every ghost variable and ghost lambda node is uniquely defined by its enabler node (possibly itself a ghost node) and the associated label $k\geq 1$.

Ghost nodes thus defined will be used as placeholders to respectively represent eta-expanded lambda nodes and variable nodes.

By convention ghost variables and lambda nodes are assigned arity $0$.

\subsubsection{Justified sequence of nodes}

A \defname{justified sequence} is a sequence of nodes from the computation tree where every node in the sequence, except the first one, has an associated link (the ``justification pointer'' or ``link'') pointing to some previous node occurrence in the sequence (called its ``justifier'') such as the two nodes are related by the enabling relation $\enables$ (the justifier node must enables the node pointing to it).

A justified sequence verifies the \defname{alternation condition} if the first node is a lambda node and subsequent nodes occurrences alternate between (i) a variable or application node (ii) a lambda node. From now on we will only consider justified sequences verifying the alternation condition.

It might be helpful here to highlight the fact that the enabling relation is \emph{statically} induced by the structure of the tree and defined on nodes of the tree, whereas the justification relation is defined on \emph{occurrences} of nodes and is specific to a given justified sequence.

We say that an occurrence of a node in a justified sequence is \defname{hereditarily justified by some other occurrence} if recursively following justification pointers starting from it leads to that other occurrence in the sequence. Because justification pointers must honor the enabling relation $\enables$ induced by the term structure, if a node occurrence $n$ is hereditarily justified by some occurrence of a node $m\in\Nodes$ then $n$ is necessarily hereditarily enabled by $m$. Further if $m$ occurs only once in the justified sequence then the occurrences hereditarily justified by $m$ are precisely the occurrences of nodes that are hereditarily \emph{enabled} by $m$.

For any justified sequence $t$ we write $t^\omega$ to denote the last occurrence in $t$, and $\jp(t)$ to denote the prefix of $t$ ending at the justifier of the last node of $t$. We say that $t$ is an \defname{extension} of justified sequence $u$ if $u$ is a strict subsequence of $t$ sharing the same justification pointers.

We use the standard game-semantic operations for justified sequences \cite{Abr02}. In particular we refer to the P-view of a justified sequence $s$, denoted $\pview{s}$, as the sub-sequence of $s$ obtained by reading the sequence backwards as follows: (i) if the node being read is a variable node then keep that node and follow its justification pointer (\ie, skip  all the occurrences ``underneath that pointer'') (ii) if the node is a lambda node then keep that node and move to the preceding node. The O-view, denoted $\oview{t}$, is defined as the dual of the P-view.

\begin{definition}[Projection]
Let $s$ be a justified sequence of nodes.

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $n$ be a node occurring in $s$ we write $s\filter n$ to denote the subsequence of $s$ obtained by keeping only nodes that are hereditarily justified by $n$ in $s$. We call it the \defname{projection of $s$} with respect to $n$;

 \item Let $A$ be a subset of nodes in $\Nodes$, we write $s \filter A$ to denote the subsequence of $s$ obtained by keeping only nodes that are in $A$;

 \item We call $s\filter\NodeHjByRoot$ the \defname{core} of $s$;

 \item We call $\pview{s\filter\NodeHjByRoot}$ the \defname{core P-view} of $s$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Observe that if the root of the tree occurs only once in $s$ then
$s \filter \theroot = s\filter\NodeHjByRoot$, where $\theroot$ denotes the occurrence of the root in $s$.



\subsection{Traversals}

\begin{definition}[Traversals]
We define the set of \defname{traversals} of an untyped lambda term $M$, denoted $\travset(M)$, or just abbreviated as $\travset$ when the term is clear from context, as the set of justified sequences of nodes in the computation tree of $M$ (\ie, $\Nodes + \ghostlmd + \ghostvar$) with associated pointers defined by induction over the rules of Table \ref{tab:trav_rules}.

A traversal that does not have any extension is a \defname{maximal traversal}.
\end{definition}

Note that those rules closely match those of \cite{BlumPhd} for STLC and PCF. In the ULC setting, however, there is no interpreted constants therefore rules \rulenamet{Value} and \rulenamet{InputValue} from the original presentation are not needed.

\begin{FramedTable}
\noindent {\bf PROGRAM -- Structural rules}
\begin{itemize}[]
    \item\rulenamet{Root} The singleton sequence $r$ is in $\travset$ where $r$ is the root of the tree.

    \item \rulenamet{App} If $t \cdot @$ is a traversal then so is \Pstr[0.4cm]{t \cdot (at) @  \cdot (a-at,40:0) \alpha} where $\alpha\in\NodesLmd$ is $@$'s $0$th child $\lambda$-node.

    \item \rulenamet{Lam} If $t \cdot \alpha$ is a traversal where $\alpha\in\NodesLmd$ then so is
        $t \cdot \alpha \cdot n$ where $n$
        denotes $\alpha$'s unique child and its justifier is defined as follows.
        \begin{compactitem}
            \item \rulenamet{Lam^@} If $n$ is an $@$-node then it has no justifier,
            \item \rulenamet{Lam^{\sf var}} If $n$ is a free variable node then it points
            to the only occurrence of the root in
            $\pview{t \cdot \alpha}$. If $n$ is a bound variable then it points to the only occurrence of its binder in $\pview{t\cdot \alpha}$.
        \end{compactitem}

 \end{itemize}

     $m \in \NodesVar^\ghostvar \union \Nodes_{@}$; and $\alpha \in \NodesLmd^\ghostlmd$ then:
  $$\Pstr[0.5cm]{ t  \cdot

\end{description}
\end{itemize}


\caption{Game-semantic traversal rules for the untyped lambda calculus (ULC).}
 \label{tab:trav_rules}
\end{FramedTable}

\begin{remark}
The traversal rules are well-defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule \rulenamet{Lam}: An easy induction shows that the P-view of a traversal ending with a structural node is precisely the path from the root of the tree to last node of the traversal (with associated justification pointers).
Therefore, if the last node is a variable node, its enabler necessarily occurs exactly once in the P-view.
\item Rule \rulenamet{Var}: In the concrete sub-case, $m$ is necessarily itself a structural node since $|m|\geq i>0$, and its $i$th child exists in $\Nodes$ since $m$ as arity greater than $i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}


\subsubsection{Comparison with STLC}
There are three important differences between the rules of Table \ref{tab:trav_rules} and the traversal rules of the simply-typed lambda calculus introduced in \cite{Blum2006}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the original STLC traversals, the term gets eta-long expanded prior to calculating the set of traversals. This guarantees that the operand of an application always exists in the tree. In ULC, however, eta-long expansion is an infinite process, so instead of eta-long expanding the term beforehand, we eta-expand on the fly as neeeded. Eta-expansion occurs in rule \rulenamet{Var} when the arity of a variable in operand position is too low to be able to statically determine the operand of an application (case when $i>|n|$). When the variable arity is high enough ($i\geq|n|$), the two versions of the rule (for STLC and ULC) coincide and the static tree representation of the term dictates which node to traverse next.

  \item Similarly, the input-variable rule allows for infinitely many eta-expansions ($k>0$).

  \item There is an additional rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostlmd} for the case where a traversal ends with a ghost lambda node. In the concrete case, rule \rulenamet{Lam} just visit the unique child node of the last lambda node in the traversal. In the eta-expanded version where the last node is a ghost lambda node, there is no such child node, so we just create an imaginary one: the variable node that would be created if we were to eta-expand the sub-term under the lambda.
      This gives the intuition behind the value $j = |\alpha| + i - |n|$ in the rule definition: the ghost placeholder $\ghostvar$ represents an occurrence of the $j$th variable that would be bound by lambda node $\alpha$ if the sub-term at node $\alpha$ were eta-expanded $i-|n|$ times.
  (Observe that in this case we necessarily have $i>|n|$ since the $i$th child of $n$ is a ghost variable node.)

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Ghost nodes in ULC traversals}

Ghost nodes appear in a traversal when the arity of a node is too low to continue a
structural traversal of the tree:
\begin{property}
If $\Pstr[0.5cm]{(x){x} \cdots (y-x,30:i){y}} \in \travset$ then
$$ y \in \ghostvar \mbox{ or } y \in\ghostlmd \iff i > |x|.$$

In particular for all $n\in\NodesVar$ and $\alpha\in\NodesLmd$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Pstr[0.5cm]{(x){n} \cdots (y-x,30:i){\ghostlmd}} \in \travset \implies i > |n|$
\item $\Pstr[0.5cm]{(x){\alpha} \cdots (y-x,30:i){\ghostvar}} \in \travset \implies i > |n|$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{property}

\begin{definition}
We call \defname{ghost materialization} any application of a traversal rule  where the last occurrence in the traversal before the rule is applied is a ghost nodes ($\ghostvar$ or $\ghostlmd$), and the new node traversed after applying some traversal rule is a structural node of the tree (in $\Nodes$).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Only \rulenamet{Var} can materialize a ghost node]
Observe that among all the rules defined in Table \ref{tab:trav_rules}, the rule \rulenamet{Var} is the only rule that can materialize a structural node in $\Nodes$ from a traversal ending with a ghost node. This means that after traversing ghost nodes, the only way to come back to strucutural nodes is to visit a ghost variable node $\ghostvar$ with an application of rule \rulenamet{Var} of the following form:

$$\rulename{Var}\ \  \Pstr[0.5cm]{ t \cdot(beta){\beta} \cdot
(y){y} \cdot (l){\alpha}  \ldots (t-l,30:i){\ghostvar}
    \cdot (lx-y,40:i){\lambda \overline{x}}
     \in\travset}$$
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $y \in \NodesVar$
\item $\lambda \overline{x} \in \NodesLmd$ is the $i$th child lambda node of $y \in \NodesVar$,
\item $\alpha$ is either a structural lambda node in $\Nodes_\lambda$ or a ghost lambda node in $\ghostlmd$
\item $0\leq \alpha < i \leq |y|$.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}




\section{Game semantic correspondence}
Following the simply-typed framework of \cite{BlumPhd}, the rule \rulenamet{IVar} is defined so as to obtain the correspondence with game semantics: the nodes visited by this rule correspond to moves played by the Opponent in the game denotation. (We recall that in Game Semantics, the Opponent represents the environment of the program, or in other words, it models the larger program context in which the program is being executed. In particular, it determines the input data that is provided to the program.)
We aim to prove that this presentation yields an isomorphism between the set of traversals and the revealed game semantics of the ULC term, and subsequently that it yields an isomorphism between the standard game semantics and the set of traversal cores (i.e., projected wrt. the root):

The traversal-game semantics isomoprhism of \cite{BlumPhd} for STLC also yields for ULC using traversal definition from Table \ref{tab:trav_rules} and the game model of ULC from Ker's thesis.

\begin{conjecture}[ULC Traversals Correspondence with Game Semantics]
\label{thm:ulc_corresp}
For every untyped lambda-term $M$ there exist two bijections
$\phi_M$ and $\psi_M$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \varphi_M  &:& \travset(M)^\star \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \syntrevsem{M} \\
 \psi_M  &:& \travset(M)^{\filter \theroot} \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \sem{M} \enspace .
\end{eqnarray*}

where
$\sem{M}$ denotes the innocent \emph{effectively almost everwhere (EAC)} game denotation of $M$ defined in \cite{KerThesis},
and $\syntrevsem{M}$ denotes the corresponding interaction game denotation where internal moves are not hidden during strategy composition.

$\travset(M)^\star$ denotes the set of traversals where application nodes are removed, and $\travset(M)^{\filter
\theroot}$ denotes the set of traversal cores of $M$ (\ie, traversal projected to the root of the tree).
\end{conjecture}
\begin{proof}
\todo{add proof sketch!}
Should follow the same argument as \cite{BlumPhd} but using the Ker's game model of ULC instead of the innocent game model of STLC.
Our ``on-the-fly'' eta-expansion should correspond to the $Fun : U \rightarrow (U \Rightarrow U)$ morphism of Ker's game category where $U$ denotes the maximal arena.
\end{proof}


\section{Traversals for normalizing ULC term}

In STLC, as mentioned in the introduction, the Correspondence Theorem \ref{thm:ulc_corresp} yields a method to normalize a simply-typed lambda term.

Indeed, the beta-normal form of a simply-typed term $M$ is uniquely determined by the maximal paths of its tree representation. And by the Game-Traversal Correspondence Theorem, the set of traversals of the beta-normal form of $M$ is precisely the set of projections, with respect to the root, of the traversals of $M$. Furthermore, by the Path-P-view correspondence, the set of of paths of the beta-normal form is given by the set of P-views of projections of traversals of $M$. Hence the P-views of maximal traversals of $M$ yields maximal paths in the tree representation of the beta-normal form of $M$.
Formally:
\begin{equation}
\pview{\travset(M)\filter\theroot} = \pathset(\betanf{M}) \label{eqn:pviewcore_paths}
\end{equation}
where $\pathset (M)$ denotes the set of maximal paths in the computation tree representation of $M$.
Observe that the set of traversals can be infinite because the game denotation of a term must account for all possible moves of the Opponent for all possible denotation of the context term (think of context terms where some parameter is repeatedly called exactly $k$ times where $k$ is unbound). Fortunately, such traversals are redundant when it comes to normalizing the term: one can limit the set of traversals to the subset of \emph{branch traversals} where such behaviour is not allowed for the Opponent while still preserving the above equality.
This is formalized in Proposition \ref{prop:branching_traversal_normalizing}.

In this section we aim to prove the same result for the untyped lambda calculus (ULC). We will then prove the Equation \ref{eqn:pviewcore_paths} in context of the untyped lambda calculus based on the ULC traversal definition of
Table \ref{tab:trav_rules}.

\subsubsection{The core P-view correspondence for ULC}

Because ULC is not strongly-normalizing, maximal traverals are not finite. There is therefore no notion of `last occurrence' in such traversal, which means that the P-view itself is undefined. We will instead consider P-views of finitary approximations of traversals. In other words, for ULC, the equation above becomes:
$$ \Union_{k>0} \pview{\travset^k(M)\filter\theroot} = \pathset(\betanf{M}) . $$
for any untyped lambda term $M$
where $\pathset (M)$, or just $\pathset$ if the term is clear from context, denotes the set of \emph{possibly infinite} maximal paths in the infinitary computation tree representation of the normal form of $M$.
and  $\travset^k(M)$ denotes the set of traversals of length $k$ at most.

\todo{add reference to paper with formalization of the concept of infinitary computation tree.}

\subsection{Context-affine traversals}

A lambda term is \defname{affine} if every bound variable in the term occurs at most once in the term.

Intuition: in the definition of traversals from Table \ref{tab:trav_rules}, the rule \rulenamet{IVar} is defined so as to account for all possible moves from the opponent O. This is needed to get the isomorphism with the game denotation of a term. For instance this is necessary to model contexts terms like the Kierstead terms $\lambda f.f(\lambda x.f(\lambda y.y))$ and $\lambda f.f(\lambda x.f(\lambda y.x))$. So for any lambda term $M$, its game denotation must contain plays with two occurrences of the same O-move representing the two separate occurrences of $f$.

In the game denotation of a lambda term $M$, at every point in a given play where it is Opponent's turn to play, all possible Opponent moves are accounted for. This guarantees that the denotation models all possible behaviours of contextual terms interacting with $M$, including behaviours not necessarily representable by a lambda term (e.g., in a typed setting, the context may range over a PCF term or Idealized Algol term).

For the sake of computing the beta normal form of a term, however, it is sufficient to only consider sufficiently enough plays to cover all paths of the tree representation of the beta-normal form of the term. For instance, we will now show that it is enough to consider plays modeling interaction with contexts where bound variables are referenced at most once.

\begin{definition}[Context-affine traversals]
For any traversal $t$ we will consider the set of triplets defining all possible O-move enabled by variable nodes in the O-view of $t$:
$$ E(t) = \left\{ (m, k, \alpha) \in \NodesVar^\ghostvar\times\nat^1\times \NodesLmd^\ghostlmd |\ \mbox{$m$ occurs in $\oview{t}$ and $m\enables_k\alpha$} \right\}
$$
and its subset representing all the justification pointers already present in the O-view of $t$:
$$ J(t) = \left\{ (m, k, \alpha) \in \NodesVar^\ghostvar\times\nat^1\times \NodesLmd^\ghostlmd
|\ \mbox{$\alpha$ is justified by $m$ in $\oview{t}$ with label $k$} \right\}
$$

We define the set of \defname{context-affine traversals} $\travsetaffine$ as the subset of $\travset$ defined by induction with the rules of Table \ref{tab:trav_rules} (substituting $\travsetaffine$ for $\travset$ everywhere) where the input-variable rule $\rulefont{IVar}$ is constrained as follows:

\infrule[$\rulefont{IVar}_\affine$]
     {
            t = t_1 \cdot m \cdot t_2 \in \travsetaffine
            \andalso t^\omega \in \NodeHjByRoot \inter \NodesVar
            \andalso (m,k,\alpha) \in E(t) \setminus J(t)
            \andalso k \geq 1
     }
     {\Pstr[0.5cm]{t_1 \cdot (m){m} \cdot t_2 \cdot (l-m,25:k){\alpha}} \in \travsetaffine}
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}[Affine traversals are sufficient for normalization]
For every traversal $t\in\travset$ there exists an affine traversal $u \in \travsetaffine$ such that
$$\pview{u\filter\theroot} = \pview{t\filter\theroot} \ .$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\todo{Formalize intuition explained above in a proof. (see handwritten notes)}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Branching traversals}
We now show a stricter result: for the purpose of normalizing a term, it is sufficient to consider traversals where we restrict the non-determinism in rule \rulenamet{IVar} such that the visited lambda nodes is necessarily justified be the immediately preceding input variable node.
The intuition is that the non-determinism in those two rules corresponds to branching points in a depth-first exploration of the beta-normal form of the term. Because there is no possible side-effect in lambda terms, it is enough to explore each possible branch of the tree in a separate traversal.

\todo{Example: The Kierstead term contexts are excluded (as in the affine case)
because $f$ cannot be called twice. But this also exclude the context $\lambda f g . f (\lambda f (\lambda x . g (\lambda y . x)))$ where the two calls to the distinct variable $f$ and $g$ bound by the same node cannot be modeled by this notion of traversal.}

\begin{definition}
We define the set of \defname{branching traversals} $\travsetbr$ as the subset of $\travset$ defined by induction with the rules of Table \ref{tab:trav_rules} (substituting $\travsetbr$ for $\travset$ everywhere) with the two input-variable rules replaced by:
\infrule[$\rulefont{IVar}_\branching$]
     {t \cdot n \in \travsetbr
      \andalso n \in\NodeHjByRoot \inter \NodesVar
      \andalso n \enables_k \alpha
      \andalso k \geq 1
     }
     {\Pstr[0.5cm]{t \cdot (n){n} \cdot (l-n,25:k){\alpha}} \in \travsetbr}
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}[Branching traversals are sufficient for normalization]
\label{prop:branching_traversal_normalizing}
For every traversal $t\in\travset$ there exists $u \in \travsetbr$ such that
$$\pview{u\filter\theroot} = \pview{t\filter\theroot} \ .$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\todo{todo!}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Ghost nodes intuition}

It is helpful to think of ghost nodes as the counterpart of complex numbers sometimes used in mathematics
to prove trigonometry identities: they are introduced intermediately to perform some computation or calculation (e.g. using De Moivre's Theorem) but do not appear in the final result. Just like the imaginary number $i$ is created out of the impossibility of calculating the square root of $-1$, ghost nodes are defined from the impossibility of ``traversing'' a beta-redex of a lambda term due to an insufficient number of operands.

\subsection{Arity threshold}

In this section, we show that, for the purpose of computing beta normal forms, the value $i$ in rule $\rulename{IVar}$ can be bounded by a computable quantity called the \defname{arity threshold} of a traversal.

When traversing a lambda term, we introduce ghost nodes on-demand each time an eta-expansion is deemed necessary.
We don't want, of course, to eta-expand ad-infinitum: Our goal is to find a finite representation of the normalized the term, as opposed to compute the possibly infinite set of traversals representing the semantic denotation of the term (i.e., it's game semantic denotation). To that extend, traversing ghost nodes in a traversal is only useful if it eventually leads to traversing some structural node of the tree.

Intuitively, after a sufficiently large number of eta-expansions, we are guaranteed to keep on traversing ghost nodes that never materialize back to structural nodes. This section formalizes this intuition by introducing the \defname{arity threshold} as the maximum number of times that is necessary to eta-expand a given subterm with traversal rule $\rulename{IVar}$ in order to compute the set of paths of the beta-normal form of the term. We will show later that such limit is sufficient in order to retrieve the normal form of a lambda term when it exists.

\begin{definition}[Weave]
We call \defname{weave} of a traversal $t$, any sub-sequence of consecutive nodes from $t$,
with even length, starting with a lambda nodes and finishing with a variable node both hereditarily justified by the root, and such that all the occurrences in-between are hereditarily justified by an application node (\ie, not by the root).

From the parity property of traversals, a weave consists of alternations of lambda nodes and variable/application nodes. It is convenient to represent a weave as follows for some $k\geq 1$ where for $j$ ranging from $k$ down to $1$, $\alpha_j$ is a lambda node in $\NodesLmd^\ghostlmd$ and $n_j$ is a variable/application node in $\NodesVar^\ghostvar$:

$$ t = \cdots \underline{\alpha_k}\ n_k\ \alpha_{k-1}\ n_{k-1}\ \cdots\ \alpha_2\ n_2\ \alpha_1\ \underline{n_1} \cdots $$

The first and last occurrences of the weave are underlined; the $2k-2$ nodes occurring in between are those that are not hereditarily justified by the root.

For any occurrence $n$ in $t$ that is hereditarily justified by the root, we call \defname{weave ending at $n$} the sequence of nodes ending at $n$ that constitutes a weave. It can be obtained by taking the longest subsequence of nodes preceding $n$ that are not hereditarily justified by the root.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Traversal arity threshold]
\label{dfn:arity-threshold}
Let $t$ be traversal ending with a variable node hereditarily justified by the root.
Let $\underline{\alpha_k}\ n_k\ \alpha_{k-1}\ n_{k-1}\ \cdots\ \alpha_2\ n_2\ \alpha_1\ \underline{n_1}$ be the weave of $t$ ending at $t^\omega$, (so that $n_1 = t^\omega$) for some $k>0$  where $\alpha_j \in \NodesLmd^\ghostlmd$, and $n_j \in \NodesVar^\ghostvar$ for all $1\leq j\leq k$.

We define the \defname{arity threshold} of $t$ as:
\begin{align*}
\arth(t) &= \max_{q=1..k-1} \left( |n_q| + \sum_{j=1..q-1} (|n_j| - |\alpha_j|) \right)\ .
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Observe that rule $\rulename{IVar}$ leaves infinitely many choices for the link label: any value greater than $1$. The following result shows that, for calculating paths in the tree representation of the beta-normal form of the term, it suffices to consider link labels that are strictly smaller than the arity threshold.

\begin{property}[Weaving]
\label{prop:weaving}
Let $t \in \travsetbr$ be a branching traversal ending with a variable node hereditarily justified by the root. Let $2k$ be the length of the weave ending at $t^\omega$ for $k\geq1$. Suppose $t_{max} \in \travsetbr$ is a maximal traversal extension of $t$, in which case by rule $\rulename{IVar}_\branching$, the node immediately after $t$ is a lambda node justified by $t^\omega$ with label $i\geq 1$. Then:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $i>\arth(t)$ then $t^\omega$ is followed in $t_{max}$ by a weave of length $2k$ consisting only of ghost nodes:
$$ t_{max} = \Pstr[0.3cm]{ \cdots
(ak){\underline{\alpha_k}}\ (nk){n_k}\
(ak1)\alpha_{k-1}\ (nk1){n_{k-1}}\
\cdots\
(a2)\alpha_2\ (n2){n_2}\
(a1)\alpha_1\ (n1){\underline{t^\omega}}\
(l1-n1,30:i){\underline{\ghostlmd}}\ (v1-a1,30)\ghostvar\
(l2-n2,30)\ghostlmd\ (v2-a2,30)\ghostvar\
 \cdots\
(lk1-nk1,30)\ghostlmd\ (vk1-ak1,30)\ghostvar\
(lk-nk,30)\ghostlmd\ (vk-ak,30){\underline{\ghostvar}} \cdots } $$

where $\underline{\alpha_k}\ n_k\ \alpha_{k-1}\ n_{k-1}\ \cdots\ \alpha_2\ n_2\ \alpha_1\ \underline{n_1}$ denotes the weave ending at $n_1 = t^\omega$.

\item If $i>\arth(t)$ then \emph{all the nodes} following $t^\omega$ in any traversal extension of $t$ are ghost nodes.
\end{enumerate}
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
(i) Consider the inclusive sub-sequence of nodes from $\alpha$ to $m$. By the alternation property of traversals, it contains $2k$ nodes for some $k\geq1$. Let's write this sequence as a succession of lambda nodes $\alpha_q$ and variable nodes $n_q$, with indices going from $k$ down to $1$. We start indexing from $\alpha$ so that $\alpha_k = \alpha$ and $n_1 = n$.

We show by finite induction on $k\geq1$ that the first $2k$ nodes after $t^\omega$ are successive pairs of ghost lambda and ghost variable nodes justified in order by $n_1, \alpha_1, n_2, \alpha_2, n_3, \ldots, n_k, \alpha_k$ with respective labels $i_1, i_2, i_2, i_3, i_3, \cdots, i_{k-1}, i_{k-1}, i_k$ defined by:
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
i_1 &= i \\
i_{q+1} &= i_q + |\alpha_q| - |n_q| \hbox{, $1\leq q < k$}.
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}

Or equivalently:
\begin{eqnarray*}
t_{max} &=& \Pstr[0.3cm]{ \cdots
 (alpha){\alpha_k} \ (nk){n_k} \
 (alphakm1){\alpha_{k-1}} \
 \cdots\
 (a2){\alpha_2}\ (n2){n_2}\ (a1){\alpha_1}\ (n1){t^\omega}\
 (l1-n1,30:i_1){\ghostlmd}\
 (t1-a1,40:i_2){\ghostvar} \ (l2-n2,41:i_2){\ghostlmd}\
  (t2-a2,45:i_3){\ghostvar} \cdots
(tkm1-alphakm1,40:i_{k-1}){\ghostvar} \ (lkm1-nk,43:i_{k-1}){\ghostlmd}\
 (tk-alpha,45:i_k){\ghostvar} \cdots }\\
i_{q+1} &=& i + \sum_{j=1..q} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|)
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Base case $q=1$: Because $t^\omega$ is a ghost variable node hereditarily justified by the root, the only next rule that can be applied is \rulenamet{IVar_\branching}, and by assumption the following node is a ghost lambda node justified by $t^\omega$ with label $i_1 = i$. Then by rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostlmd_\branching} the next node is a ghost variable justified by $\alpha$ with label $i_2 = i + |\alpha_1| - |t^\omega|$.

$$ t_{max} = \Pstr[0.3cm]{ \cdots (alpha){\alpha_1}\ (m){t^\omega} (l-m,30:i){\ghostlmd}\ (t-alpha,45:i_2){\ghostvar} \cdots} $$

\item For $1<q\leq k$, by the induction hypothesis we have:
$$
t_{max} = \Pstr[0.3cm]{
   \cdots
  (aq){\alpha_q}\
  (nq){n_q} \
  (aqm1){\alpha_{q-1}}\
  (nqm1){n_{q-1}} \
 \cdots\
 t^\omega\ \cdots
  (lk-nqm1,35:{i_{q-2}})\ghostlmd\
  (tq-aqm1,40:{i_{q-1}})\ghostvar\
   \cdots
}
$$

We then have:
\begin{align*}
i_{q-1} &= i + \sum_{j=1..q-2} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|)
&\qquad\hbox{(by induction hypothesis)}\\
        &> \arth(t) + \sum_{j=1..q-2} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|)
&\qquad\hbox{(assumption $i> \arth(t)$)} \\
        &= \max_{r=1..k-1} \left( |n_r| + \sum_{j=1..r-1} (|n_j| - |\alpha_j|) \right)
        + \sum_{j=1..q-2} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|)
& \qquad\hbox{(definition of $\arth$)} \\
    &\geq |n_q| + \sum_{j=1..q-2} (|n_j| - |\alpha_j|) + \sum_{j=1..q-2} (|\alpha_j| - |n_j|)
&\qquad\hbox{(take $r=q-1$)} \\
    &= |n_q|
\end{align*}


By definition of the weave, $\alpha_{q-1}$ is hereditarily justified by an $@$ node.
Since $i_{q-1} > |n_q|$, by rule \rulenamet{Var_\branching} the next node is necessarily a ghost lambda node justified by $n_q$ with label $i_q$. With rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostlmd_\branching} the following node is a ghost variable node $\ghostvar$ justified by $\alpha_q$ and labelled by $i_q = i_{q-1} + |\alpha_{q-1}| -|n_{q-1}|$.
\end{itemize}

(ii) By (i) the next weave following $t$ consists solely of ghost nodes and ends with a ghost variable $\ghostvar$ hereditarily justified by the root. Since ghost nodes have arity $0$, the arity threshold at that point is $0$. Hence, any label value $j$ chosen to extend the traversal at that point will be strictly greater than the arity threshold: thus by (i) the next weave consists solely of ghost nodes.
By repeating the argument this shows that all the nodes following $t$ are necessarily ghost nodes.
\end{proof}

This property leads to the following definition:
\begin{definition}[Normalizing traversals]
We define the set of \defname{normalizing traversals}, noted $\travsetnorm$ as the set of maximal traversals obtained from the induction rule of Table \ref{tab:trav_rules} where the value $i$ in the rule \rulenamet{IVar} is bounded by the arity of the traversal from Definition \ref{dfn:arity-threshold}:

\subsection{Normalizing ULC terms: examples}
In this section we demonstrate on various walk-through examples, how the beta-normal form of a term can be calculated by traversing the term using the normalizing traversals of Table \ref{tab:normalizing_trav_rules}.

\begin{example}[Baby example]
  Take $M = (\lambda x. x x) (\lambda y. y)$. Repeatedly applying the structural traversal rules yields the following traversal:

  $t = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda x}\ (n3-n2){x}\ (n4-n1){\lambda y}\ (n5-n4){y}\ (n6-n3){\lambda }\ (n7-n2){x}\ (n8-n1){\lambda y}\ (n9-n8){y}\ (n10-n7){\ghostlmd^1}\ (n11-n6){\ghostvar^1}\ (n12-n5){\ghostlmd^{1}}\ (n13-n4){\ghostvar^2}\ (n14-n3){\ghostlmd^2}\ (n15-n2){\ghostvar^2}\ (n16-n1){\ghostlmd^2}\ (n17-n0){\ghostvar^1}}$

At this point, the last node of $t$ is a variable justified by the root so we could apply rule $\rulename{IVar}$ to get further game-semantic traversals. However, the traversal's arity threshold is $arth(t) = 0$ therefore there is no more \emph{normalizing} traversal to explore: $t$ is a maximal normalizing traversal. The P-view core of the traversal is $\pview{t\filter\theroot} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n17-n0){\ghostvar^1}}$ thus the beta-normal form of $M$ is, up to $\alpha$-conver $\lambda y . y$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}[Church increment: ``${\sf add}\ 1$'']
Consider the Church numerals written $k \equiv \lambda s z . s^k z$ for $k\geq0$. We consider a term $M$ representing the increment function that adds $1$ to the input integer: $M k$ reduces to $(k+1)$ for all $k$. Such term can be defined as $M \equiv{\sf add}\ 1$ where
${\sf add} \equiv \lambda x y s z. x\, s (y\, s\, z)$.
Note that $M$ is not beta-normal.
The computation tree $\tau(M)$ of $M$ is:
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(root.base),level distance=5ex,inner ysep=0.5mm,sibling distance=10mm]
\node (root)
{$\lambda$}
child {node{$@$}
    child{node{$\lambda x y s z$}
        child { node{$x$}
            child{node{$\lambda$}{
                child {node {$s$}}}
            }
            child{node{$\lambda$}
                child{node{$y$}
                    child{node{$\lambda$}
                        child{ node {$s$}}
                    }
                    child{node{$\lambda$}
                        child{node{$z$}}}
                }
            }
        }
    }
    child{node{$\lambda s z$}
        child{node{$s$}
            child{node{$\lambda$} child{node{$z$}}}
        }
    }
}

\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{itemize}
\item Applying as many deterministic rules as possible gives the following traversal at which point the Opponent must make a choice:

$t_\epsilon = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}\ (n3-n2){x}\ (n4-n1){\lambda s z}\ (n5-n4){s}\ (n6-n3){\lambda }\ (n7-n2){s}\ (n8-n1){\ghostlmd^3}\ (n9-n0){\ghostvar^2} }$

(For readability we indicate the link label in exponent of the source node when representing traversals.)
The core of $t_\epsilon$ is
$t_\epsilon\filter\theroot = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda } \cdot (n9-n0){{\ghostvar^2}} }$
and therefore $\pview{t_\epsilon\filter\theroot} =  \lambda \cdot \ghostvar^2$ is a path in  $\betanf{M}$.
This means that $\betanf{M}$ must be of the form $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot y N_1 \ldots \ldots N_q$ for some fresh variable $y$ and $s$ and $q\geq0$.

\item In order to determine what each argument $N_k$ is in the final normal form, we eta-expand by applying rule $\rulename{IVar}$ for each possible argument index $k\geq 1$ and then continue applying the traversal rules.

For $k=1$ we get the traversal:

$t_1 = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}\ (n3-n2){x}\ (n4-n1){\lambda s z}\
(n5-n4){s}\ (n6-n3){\lambda }\
(n7-n2){s}\ (n8-n1){\ghostlmd^3}\
(n9-n0){\ghostvar^2}
(n10-n9){\ghostlmd^1}
(n11-n8){\ghostvar^1}
(n12-n7){\ghostlmd^1}
(n13-n6){\ghostvar^1}
(n14-n5){\lambda^1}
(n15-n4)z
(n16-n3){\lambda^2}
(n17-n2)y
(n18-n1){\ghostlmd^2}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
}$

The P-view of the traversal core is
$\pview{t_1\filter\theroot} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(l){\lambda } \cdot (x-l){\ghostvar^2} \cdot (l1-x){\ghostlmd^1}
\cdot (x2-l){\ghostvar^1}
}$
which means that the normal form is of the form $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s (y R_1 \ldots R_{q_2}) N_2 \ldots N_q$ for some terms $R_1$, \ldots $R_{q_2}$, and $q,q_2\geq 0$.

\item What should be the value of $q$? In other words, how many more $k$ do we need to look at?  The answer: we need to keep iterating on $k$ until the point where applying the traversal rules will only produce ghost variables and ghost lambda-nodes! Because there is a finite number of nodes in the computation tree, the variable node arities are bounded. Therefore for high enough index $k$, the eta-expansion case from rule \rulenamet{Var} will never be met:
        after applying rule \rulenamet{IVar} on $t_\epsilon$, all subsequent extensions of the traversal will be constructed using repeated applications of rule $\rulename{Lam^\ghostvar}$ or the eta-expanded case of rule $\rulename{Var}$.
     The upper-bound $q$ for $k$ is precisely given by the \emph{arity threshold} of the traversal $t_\epsilon$ as defined in \ref{dfn:arity-threshold}.
     Here we have
     \begin{align*}
     \arth(t_\epsilon)
     = \max \{ & |s^2| , \\
               & |s^1| + (|s^2| - |\lambda|) , \\
               & |x| +  (|s^1| - |\lambda s z|) + (|s^2| - |\lambda|)
               %& |@| + (|x|- |\lambda x y s z |) + (|s^1| - |\lambda s z|) + (|s^2| -|\lambda|) \
               \} \\
    = \max \{   & 0 , \\
                & 1 + (0 - 0) , \\
                & 2 + (1 - 2) + (0 - 0)
                %& 2 + (2 - 4) + (1 - 2) + (0 - 0)
            \} \\
     = 1
     \end{align*}
     Thus we don't need to look at higher value of $k$ at $t_\epsilon$, we thus have:
     $\betanf{M} = \lambda y s \ldots \cdot s (y R_1 \ldots R_{q_2})$.

\item The arity threshold of $t_1$ is $\arth(t_1) = |z| + |y| - |\lambda^2| = 0+2-0 = 2$ hence  $\betanf{M}$ is of the form $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s (y R_1 R_2)$.

\item Let's eta-expand using rule \rulenamet{IVar} for varying value of child index $1\leq k_2 \leq q_2 = 2$. We first look at the case $k_2 = 1$. The traversal obtained is:

$t_{11} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\lambda }\
(n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}\ (n3-n2){x}\ (n4-n1){\lambda s z}\ (n5-n4){s}\ (n6-n3){\lambda }\ (n7-n2){s}\ (n8-n1){\ghostlmd^3}\ (n9-n0){\ghostvar^2}
(n10-n9){\ghostlmd^1}
(n11-n8){\ghostvar^1}
(n12-n7){\ghostlmd^1}
(n13-n6){\ghostvar^1}
(n14-n5){\lambda^1}
(n15-n4)z
(n16-n3){\lambda^2}
(n17-n2)y
(n18-n1){\ghostlmd^2}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
(n20-n19){\ghostlmd^1}
(n21-n18){\ghostvar^1}
(n22-n17,60:1)\lambda % points to non-ghost node
(n23-n2,45:3) s
(n24-n1,45:3) {\ghostlmd^3}
(n25-n0,48:2) {\ghostvar^2}
}$

Thus $\pview{t_{11} \filter\theroot} =
\Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\lambda }\
 (n9-n0){\ghostvar^2}
 (n10-n9){\ghostlmd^1}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
(n20-n19){\ghostlmd^1}
(n25-n0,48:2){\ghostvar^2}
}$

Hence $\betanf{M}$ is of the form $\lambda y s \ldots \cdot s\ (y\ s\ R_2)$.

\item Now let's extend $t_1$ with \rulenamet{IVar^\lambda} for $k_2 = 2$. We get the traversal:

$t_{12} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\lambda }\
(n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda x y s z}\
(n3-n2){x}\ (n4-n1){\lambda s z}\
(n5-n4){s}\
(n6-n3){\lambda }\
(n7-n2){s}\
(n8-n1){\ghostlmd^3}\
(n9-n0) {\ghostvar^2}
(n10-n9) {\ghostlmd^1}
(n11-n8){\ghostvar^1}
(n12-n7){\ghostlmd^1}
(n13-n6){\ghostvar^1}
(n14-n5)\lambda^1
(n15-n4)z
(n16-n3){\lambda^2}
(n17-n2)y
(n18-n1){\ghostlmd^2}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
(n20-n19){\ghostlmd^2} %%%%%%%%
(n21-n18){\ghostvar^2}
(n22-n17,60:2)\lambda % points to non-ghost node
(n23-n2,45:4) z
(n24-n1,45:4) {\ghostlmd^4}
(n25-n0,48:3) {\ghostvar^3}
}$

Thus $\pview{t_{12} \filter\theroot} =
\Pstr[0.7cm]{
(n0){\lambda }\
 (n9-n0){{\ghostvar^2}}
 (n10-n9){\ghostlmd^1}
(n19-n0){\ghostvar^1}
(n20-n19){\ghostlmd^2}
(n25-n0,48:3) {\ghostvar^3}
}$

Hence $\betanf{M} = \lambda y s z \cdot s\ (y\ s\ z)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[``Missing operand'' example by Neil Jones]
This small example illustrates how on-the-fly eta-expansion helps resolve the ``missing argument'' problem faced when using the traversal rules of STLC. Take $M = (\lambda u . u\ (y_1\ u)) (\lambda v . v\ y_2)$.

The computation tree is:
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(root.base),level distance=5ex,inner ysep=0.5mm,sibling distance=10mm]
\node (root)
{$\lambda$}
child {node{$@$}
        child{node{$\lambda u $}
           child {node {$u$}
              child {node {$\lambda$}
                  child {node {$y_1$}
                      child {node {$\lambda$}
                          child {node {$u$}
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
           }
        }
        child{node{$\lambda v$}
            child{node{$v$}
                child{node{$\lambda$}
                    child{ node {$y_2$}}
                }
            }
        }
    }
;
\end{tikzpicture}

The only two maximal normalizing traversals are:
\begin{itemize}

\item $t_1 = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda u}\ (n3-n2){u}\ (n4-n1){\lambda v}\ (n5-n4){v}\ (n6-n3){\lambda }\ (n7-n0){y_1}\ (n8-n7){\lambda }\ (n9-n2){u}\ (n10-n1){\lambda v}\ (n11-n10){v}\ (n12-n9){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n13-n8){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n14-n13){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n15-n12){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n16-n11){\lambda }\ (n17-n0,35){y_2}\ }$
\item $t_2 = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1){@}\ (n2-n1){\lambda u}\ (n3-n2){u}\ (n4-n1){\lambda v}\ (n5-n4){v}\ (n6-n3){\lambda }\ (n7-n0){y_1}\ (n8-n7){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}\ (n9-n6){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n10-n5){\lambda }\ (n11-n0){y_2}\ }$
\end{itemize}
Using the STLC traversals, one can traverse $t_1$ all the way to variable $v$ at which point we get stuck due to the lack of operand applied to the last occurrence of $u$ (the one at the bottom of the left branch in the tree). Using ULC rule, that operands gets created on-the-fly through eta-expansion and is represented by ghost lambda node $\ghostlmd^1$.

The two core P-views give the two paths in the beta-normal form of $M$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pview{t_1\filter\theroot} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){y_1}\ (n2-n1){\lambda }\ (n3-n2){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n4-n3){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n5-n0){y2}\ }$
\item $\pview{t_2\filter\theroot} = \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){y_1}\ (n2-n1){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}\ (n3-n0){y_2}\ }$
\end{itemize}
Thus: $\betanf{M} = \lambda x . y_1 (\lambda  z.z\ y_2) y_2$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}[Neil Jones' ``$varity\ 2$'' example]

Take $M = varity\ two$ where
\begin{align*}
  varity &\equiv \lambda t.t (\lambda n a x . n (\lambda s z . a s (x s z))) (\lambda a. a) (\lambda z_0 . z_0) \\
  two &\equiv \lambda s_2 z_2 . s_2 (s_2\ z_2)
\end{align*}

In order to compute the set of normalizing traversals, we apply the traversal rules inductively until an input variable is reached, at which point we eta-expand with rule \rulenamet{IVar} for all possible values of $k$ ranging from $1$ to the arity threshold of the traversal. The first traversal obtained is denoted $t_\epsilon$, and for every sequence of integer $s \in \nat^*$,  the traversal $t_{s \cdot k}$ represents the maximal traversal obtained after extending $t_s$ using one application of the eta-expanded subcase of rule \rulenamet{IVar} with link-label $k \in \nat$.
This process yields the set of traversals $\{t_\epsilon, t_{11}, t_{12}, t_{121}, t_{122} \}$ represented in the following pages.

\end{landscape}

Keeping only the maximal traversals gives us the following set of maximal normalizing traversals of $M$:
$$\travset^s(M) = \{ t_{11}, t_{121}, t_{122} \}$$

Hence the set of maximal paths in the beta-normal form of $M$ is given by the traversal core P-views:
\begin{align*}
\pview{t_{11} \filter \theroot} &=
    \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){{\ghostvar^{3}}}\ (n2-n1){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n3-n0){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n4-n3){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n5-n0){{\ghostvar^{3}}}}
\\
\pview{t_{121} \filter \theroot} &=
    \Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){{\ghostvar^{3}}}\ (n2-n1){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n3-n0){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n4-n3){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}\ (n5-n0){{\ghostvar^{2}}}\ (n6-n5){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n7-n0){{\ghostvar^{3}}}}
\\
\pview{t_{122} \filter \theroot} &=
\Pstr[0.7cm]{(n0){\lambda }\ (n1-n0){{\ghostvar^{3}}}\ (n2-n1){{\ghostlmd^{1}}}\ (n3-n0){{\ghostvar^{1}}}\ (n4-n3){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}\ (n5-n0){{\ghostvar^{2}}}\ (n6-n5){{\ghostlmd^{2}}}\ (n7-n0){{\ghostvar^{4}}}}
\end{align*}

Therefore the beta-normal from of $varity\ 2$ is:
\begin{align*}
\betanf{varity\ 2} &= \lambda x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 . x_3 (x_1 x_3 (x_2 x_3 x_4))\\
&\equiv_\alpha \lambda x y s z . s (x s (y s z))
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\section{Further directions}

\subsection{Higher-order collapsible pushdown automata}

In \cite{Ong2006}, a construction\footnote{This CPDA construction from HORS is implemented in the HOG tool.)}
 is defined that converts a higher-order recursion scheme into an equivalent collapsible higher-order pushdown automaton (in the sense that they generate the same infinite tree). The automaton proceeds by calculating traversals over the tree representation of the higher-order recrusion scheme. In that setting, the recursion scheme represents a closed term (no free variable) of order-$0$, and the generated structure is an order-$0$ value (a tree).

Conceivably, there must be some kind of tree-generating automaton that can be used to calculate the set of traversals of an untyped lambda term as defined in this paper. The generated tree would be an order-$0$ tree representation of the beta-normal of a term: each terminal symbol of the automaton would correspond to a ``token'' of the lambda term: either a lambda node (represented by non-terminal of type $o->o$), or a variable node (represented by a non-terminal of type $o^k->o$ where $k\geq0$ is the number of operand applied to the variable in the beta normal form of the term.

In the untyped lambda calculus, though, there is no notion of order, therefore the type-based definition of higher-order pushdown automata, where each non-terminals has a simple-type, would not be appropriate here. The definition of HOCPDA would thus need to be relaxed to allow non-terminals of any type. The construction of the HOPCPDA itself would follow the same lines as \cite{Ong2006} except that $\eta$-long normal expansion is not needed.

\subsection{Connection with compilation of ULC to LLL}

In \cite{JonesBerezunLLL}, Daniil Berezung and Neil Jones define a different version of traversals with notable differences: no ghost lambda nodes, two types of justification pointers: binding pointers and control pointers. Although very similar, the relationship between their notion of traversals and the one defined in this paper is still not formally established. Danos and Reigner's Linear Head reduction paper \cite{danos-head} appears to be the best avenue to estabilish the connection.


\subsection{Game semantics connection}

In the lines of what I did in \cite{BlumPhd} on formalizing the isomorphim between the traversal theory and Game Semantics for the simply-typed lambda calculus, PCF and Idealized Algol, a natural question to ask is whether there is a similar connection between the ULC traversals defined in this paper on game models of the untyped lambda calculus.

TODO: give intuition on why this notion of traversals probably coincides with the game model of the untyped lambda calculus by Andrew Ker.

\subsection{Head linear reduction}

Traversals have emerged as a constructive method to represetn
Relationship between Game Semantics and

In 2004, Danos and Regner \cite{danos-head} establish the connection between Game Semantics and the notion of \emph{head-linear reduction}.

Head linear reduction is  a non-standard reduction strategy for the lambda calculus and shed some light studies the connection with Game Semantics.

\subsection{Notes for Neil and Daniil}

Here are some thoughts on comparing the following three approaches
based on the conversations Neil and I had during his visit to MSR:
(i) Berezun-Jones (DJ) traversals,
(ii) Danos-Reigner's Pointer Abstract Machine (PAM) state runs,
(iii) Blum's ``paranormal'' and game-semantic-inspired traversals for ULC introduced in this note.

\subsubsection{Normalization}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Danos-Reigner: PAM implements head-linear reduction. This reduction does not itself normalize the term, it only yields the head-normal form of the term! The paper does not clearly indicate any method to normalize the term based solely on head-linear reduction.
      In particular in the PAM transition of Section 5.2, step 2, if the hoc variable is free then the machine stops: no transition applies.
  \item Berezun-Jones: Although not explicitly explained in the paper. Daniil and Neil have a ``read-out procedure''' to reconstruct the term from the traversal. The procedure is based on rewriting rules applied to the traversals.
  \item Blum: Normalization is performed by exploring all possible paths in the beta-normal form of the term. The algorithm generates one maximal traversal per path in the tree representation of the term. The term can then be uniquely recreated (up to variable naming) from those paths.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Traversal/Run structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Danos-Reigner: State run. Each state has three components: one pointer, a reference to a variable node, a reference to a subterm.
\item Berezun-Jones: Traversals of `tokens' with two pointers (control and binding pointers). A tokens is a reference to a node in the AST of the lambda term.
\item Blum: Traversals are sequences of node with one back pointer. Nodes can either be structural nodes from the `compact' AST of the term (where consecutive lambda nodes and application nodes are bundled together) or imaginary `ghost' nodes. Each node occurrence except the first one has exactly one justification pointer.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Binding pointers -- PAM pointers -- P-view}

Neil-Daniil's binding pointers represent the ``head $\lambda$-list'' notion in Danos-Reigner paper (page 3): it gives the list of lambda nodes encountered from the variable all the way to the root.

\begin{itemize}
\item Danos-Reigner: The De Bruijn index of a variable is used to find the binder in the head $\lambda$-list. If index is $k$ (by Lemma 11) the binder can be retrieved by following $k$ pointers in the PAM states. The notion of ``subterm chain'' of a variable correspond to the notion of P-view in Game Semantics.

\item  Berezun-Jones: The De Bruijn index is used to determine how many binding (green) pointers to follow to reach the occurrence of the binder in the traversal.

\item Blum: Traversals are game-semantics inspired (ala Ong) and in particular verify the alternation property. To that end, consecutive binders are bulked together in a single binder node. Given a variable occurrence, its `bulk' binder is located by reading the P-view backward by $k'$ iterations where $k'$ is statically determined as the distance between the variable occurrence and its binder in the computation tree. The label associated with the link determines which exact variable in the `bulk lambda' binds the variable.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Control pointers -- PAM -- }

\subsubsection{Retrieving application operands: Control pointers -- PAM's redex argument }
\begin{itemize}
  \item Danos-Reigner: the operands of a `prime redex' is statically defined from the term's expression (the `argument of a hoc variable', in Section 5.1)

  \item Berezun-Jones: control pointers are used to associate operators to the corresponding operand in an application: for instance if $@_1 (\lambda x .M) N$ is a redex of the tree then any occurrence of $\lambda x$ will point to some previous occurrence of $@_1$ in the traversal. The token representing the operand $N$ can then be statically determined from the AST of the tree.
      Control pointers always point to $@$ tokens.

  \item Blum: There are two cases:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Structural operands: Same as Ong's traversals: pretty much the same as Berezun-Jones with the only technical difference that consecutive lambda and applications nodes are `bulked' together. In particular, `bulk lambda' nodes point to their parent node (either a variable or an application node $@$). If the variable $x$ of the redex is the $i$th bound variable in the bulk lambda, then the operand is obtained by fetching the $i$th child of the bulkd lambda's parent node.
    \item Eta-expanded operands: When an operand is missing, a ghost lambda node is first introduced with rule \rulenamet{Var} (corresponding to the variable obtained after eta-expanding the operator). Then through repeated application of rule
        \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostlmd} and \rulenamet{Var}, either a structural node gets eventually materialized, which then represents the operand of the application; or the traversal reaches a ghost variable hereditarily justified by the root. In the latter case, a new variable gets created through eta-expansion to represent the missing operand.

        \emph{Note}: the ghost materialization loop implemented by rule \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostlmd} and \rulenamet{Var} proceeds by calculating the quantity ``$|\alpha|+i-|m|$'' at each iteration which is the exact same quantity ($r-a+l$) used in step 2. (b) of the PAM transition \cite{danos-head}, the ``price to pay for having no stacks or environments''.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Flag -- ?? -- ??}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Berezun-Jones: Semantics 2, 3, 4 and 5 from section 3 involve a mysterious `flag' boolean parameter that indicates the context of the application (either weak or strong evaluation).
  \item Danos-Reigner: ??? Must be somehow replaced by the iterative loop in step 2(b)
  \item Blum: ??? Must be somehow encoded in the iterative ghost materialization algorithm implemented by the \rulenamet{Var} and \rulenamet{Lam^\ghostlmd} rules.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Converting other traversals to the paranormal traversals}

\paragraph{From Berezun-Jones}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove single application token $@$ that are immediately followed by a variable.
\item Merge consecutive application nodes in the traversal, preserve all control pointers pointing to them. Assign link label $0$ if the source of the pointer is in operator position of the $@$, and $i >0$ if is in operand position of the $i$th merged $@$.

Remove all binding and control pointers starting from the $@$ tokens thesmelves.

\item Merge consecutive lambda tokens $\lambda x_1$, \ldots, $\lambda x_n$, $n>1$ in the traversals into single lambda nodes $\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n$.
 Binding pointers:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item For any binding pointer from some variable token $x$ in the traversal, pointing to one of the merged lambda nodes, replace the link as follows: if $x$ has deBrujin index $i$ then follow $i$ binding pointer in the original sequence. This will lead to some lambda token $\lambda x$. Make the link points instead to the merged lambda node containing that $\lambda x$. Assigned link label $i$ where $i$ is the index of the bound variable in the merged list of $x_1 \ldots x_n$.
 \item Remove all the binding pointers from either lambda or $@$ tokens that are pointing to any of the merged lambda nodes.
 \item Remove all binding pointers from the merged lambda nodes to other nodes.
 \end{itemize}
 Control pointers: preserve only the control pointer associated with the first lambda in the sequence of lambda tokens.

\item Add dummy lambdas $\lambda$ and ghost nodes: for each pair $(x,y)$ of consecutive variable tokens $x$ and $y$, processing the traversal from left to right, reconstruct the ``missing'' dummy and ghost nodes between $x$ and $y$ by applying rules \rulenamet{Lam^\normalizing} and \rulenamet{Var^\normalizing}.
{\bf TO PROVE}: by applying those rules repeatedly starting from $x$, we necessarily get back to variable nodes $y$ with the same justification pointer.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{From Danos-Regner}

Take a substitution sequence of a PAM: $((z_0,A_1), (z_1,A_2) \ldots$.
