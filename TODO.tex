- PB: How many variable names are required to generate all the
closed beta normal form of a given type?

In the lambda calculus, it is unbounded. Take the type $\tau \cong
(((o,o),o), (o^n->o), o, o)$. For any $n\in\nat$ the following beta
normal term:
$$ M \cong \lambda f g x . f (\lambda x_1.f(\lambda x_2.f(\lambda \ldots f(\lambda \ldots f(\lambda x_{n-1}.g x_1 \ldots x_{n-1}) \ldots )$$
is of type $\tau$ and uses $n$ distinct variable names. It is easy to see that
any other $\beta$-normal form using less that $n$ distinct names cannot be alpha converted to $M$
since the function $g$ expect as argument $n$ variables bound at $n$ different places.


In the safe lambda calculus, however, the number of variable names required to generate
all the closed beta normal forms is bounded by $size(\tau)-1$ where $size$ is defined by
$size(o)= 1$ and $size(\tau\tyepar\mu) = size(\tau) + size(\mu)$.
