can elegantly express many classical compiler optimizations for
imperative programming languages.  In this paper, programs are written
in an intermediate language and transformation-enabling side
conditions are specified in a temporal logic suitable for describing
program data flow.
The purpose of this paper is to show how such transformations may be
proven correct. Our methodology is illustrated by three familiar
optimizations: dead code elimination, constant folding, and code
motion.  A transformation is correct if whenever it can be applied to
a program, the original and transformed programs are semantically
equivalent, i.e., they compute the same input-output function.
The proofs of semantic equivalence inductively show that a
transformation-specific bisimulation relation holds between the
original and transformed program computations.},

    TITLE      = {Transformation by interpreter specialisation},
    JOURNAL    = {Science of Computer Programming},
    volume     = {52},
    pages      = {307--339},
    summary    = {A program may be transformed by specialising an interpreter
     for the language in which it is written. Efficiency of the transformed
     program is determined by the efficiency of the interpreter's dynamic
     operations; the efficiency of its static operations is
irrelevant, since all
     will be ``specialised away''.
     This approach is {\em automatic} (as automatic as the specialiser
     is); {\em general}, in that it applies to all of the
     interpreter's input programs; and
     {\em flexible}, in that a wide range of program transformations are
     achievable since the transformed program inherits the style of the
     interpreter.
     The chief practical challenge is understanding cause and effect:
     How should one write the interpreter so that specialisation produces
     efficient transformed programs? The core of this paper is a series of
     examples, both positive and negative, showing how the way the
     interpreter is written can influence the removal of
     interpretational overhead, and thus the efficiency and size of the
     target programs obtained by specialisation.},

  abstract =     {Lee, Jones and Ben-Amram introduced ``size-change termination'',
        a decidable property strictly stronger than termination. They invented a
        method called the ``size-change principle'' to analyze it. I propose an
        extension of the size-change principle to a subset of ML featuring ground
        type values, higher-order type values and recursively defined functions.
        Compared to other works, this is the first time that the size-change
        principle is applied to a higher-order functional language.

        The language handles natively if-then-else and let rec structures. The resulting algorithm produces the expected
        result for higher-order values but can also analyze the size of ground type values. This enhances the scope of
        the termination analyzer to some recursively defined function operating on numbers.},
