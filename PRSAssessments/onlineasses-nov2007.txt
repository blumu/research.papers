During this term, I have been working on the first chapter of my
thesis, currently entitled "Local computation of beta-redexes". This
chapter introduces a new way to perform computation of programs
written in a higher-order language such as the simply-typed
lambda-calculus. The computation proceeds by traversing some
tree-representation of the program. A theorem then shows a
correspondence between this setting and the game-semantic denotation
of the program: the set of all possible traversals is isomorphic to
the revealed game semantics of the program. I have spent a great
amount of time polishing the proof of the Correspondence Theorem.

Next term I will get back to my work on the Safe Lambda Calculus, and
try to submit a journal paper of my results on the subject so far.
