\begin{itemize}


\item find a generic encoding of any non-elementary time turing machine
in the safe lambda calculus (using a non-uniform representation of
numbers)

\item Space complexity of beta normalization at order 4 for safe terms?
EXPSPACE? Safety allows us to not have to encode variable names.

\itme Space complexity of beta eta equality at order 4 for safe terms?

\item PB: How many variable names are required to generate all the
closed beta normal form of a given type?

In the lambda calculus, it is unbounded. Take the order-3 type
$$\tau
\cong (((o,o),o), (o^n\typear o), o, o) \ . $$

For any $n\in\nat$ the following beta normal term:
$$ M \cong \lambda f g x . f (\lambda x_1.f(\lambda x_2.f(\lambda \ldots f(\lambda \ldots f(\lambda x_{n-1}.g x_1 \ldots x_{n-1}) \ldots )$$
is of type $\tau$ and uses $n$ distinct variable names. It is easy to see that
any other $\beta$-normal form using less that $n$ distinct names cannot be alpha converted to $M$
since the function $g$ expect as argument $n$ variables bound at $n$ different places.


In the safe lambda calculus, however, the number of variable names
required to generate all the closed beta normal forms is bounded by
$size(\tau)-1$ where $size$ is defined by $size(o)= 1$ and
$size(\tau\typear\mu) = size(\tau) + size(\mu)$.

\item Space complexity of normalization of safe order 4 terms.

\item All types (with one atom) are inhabited in the lambda
calculus. What about multiple atoms?

For any atom $a$, we can construct the types $\tau(n,a)$
as follows: $\tau(0,a) = a$ and $\tau(n+1,a) = \tau(n,a) \typear a$.
Take three distinct atoms $a$, $b$ and $c$. We give examples of types with some inhabitant (safe if one is known):
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any atoms $a$,$b$ and $c$ and any $i,j,k\in\nat$, the type
$(\tau(i,a) \typear \tau(j,b)) \typear (\tau(j,b) \typear \tau(k,c)) \typear \tau(i,a) \typear
\tau(k,c)$ is inhabited by the term $\lambda x y z w . y (x z)$ which is unsafe if and only if $i<j$.


\item
$(\tau(1,a) \typear \tau(2,a)) \typear (\tau(2,a) \typear \tau(4,a)) \typear \tau(1,a) \typear
\tau(4,a)$ is inhabited by the safe term $$\lambda x^{\tau(1,a)
\typear \tau(2,a)} y^{(\tau(2,a) \typear \tau(4,a))} z^{\tau(1,a)}
w^{\tau(3,a)} . x (\lambda x^a . x) (\lambda x^a . x)\ .$$

\item $(\tau(1,a) \typear \tau(2,b)) \typear (\tau(2,b) \typear \tau(4,c)) \typear \tau(1,a) \typear
\tau(4,c)$
is inhabited by the safe term:
$$ \lambda x y z w . y (\lambda g . x (\lambda a . a) (\lambda b . b)) (\lambda f . f (\lambda c . c))$$
where
$x : ((a, a), (b, b), b)$,
$y : (((b, b), b), (((c, c), c), c), c)$,
$g : (b, b)$,
$f : ((c, c), c)$. (Safe inhabitant found by Luke.)
\item
$(\tau(1,a) \typear \tau(3,b)) \typear (\tau(3,b) \typear \tau(4,c)) \typear \tau(1,c) \typear
\tau(4,c)$
is inhabited by the safe term
$$ \lambda x^{(\tau(1,a) \typear \tau(3,b))} y^{(\tau(3,b) \typear \tau(4,c))} z^{\tau(1,c)} w^{\tau(3,c)} . y (x (\lambda u^a . u)) \ .$$
\item We conjecture that $(\tau(2,a) \typear \tau(3,b)) \typear (\tau(3,b) \typear \tau(4,c)) \typear \tau(2,a) \typear
\tau(4,c)$ is not safely inhabited.
