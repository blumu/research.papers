\begin{itemize}
\item All types (with one atom) are inhabited in the lambda
calculus. What about multiple atoms?

\item find a generic encoding of any non-elementary time turing machine
in the safe lambda calculus (using a non-uniform representation of
numbers)

\item PB: How many variable names are required to generate all the
closed beta normal form of a given type?

In the lambda calculus, it is unbounded. Take the order-3 type
$$\tau
\cong (((o,o),o), (o^n\typear o), o, o) \ . $$

For any $n\in\nat$ the following beta normal term:
$$ M \cong \lambda f g x . f (\lambda x_1.f(\lambda x_2.f(\lambda \ldots f(\lambda \ldots f(\lambda x_{n-1}.g x_1 \ldots x_{n-1}) \ldots )$$
is of type $\tau$ and uses $n$ distinct variable names. It is easy to see that
any other $\beta$-normal form using less that $n$ distinct names cannot be alpha converted to $M$
since the function $g$ expect as argument $n$ variables bound at $n$ different places.


In the safe lambda calculus, however, the number of variable names
required to generate all the closed beta normal forms is bounded by
$size(\tau)-1$ where $size$ is defined by $size(o)= 1$ and
$size(\tau\typear\mu) = size(\tau) + size(\mu)$.

\item Space complexity of normalization of safe order 4 terms.
